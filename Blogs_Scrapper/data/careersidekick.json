Tell me about yourself</h3>\n<p>This is one of the most common interview questions, and it trips a lot of job seekers up because of how open-ended it is. Here\u2019s what the best answers include, and how to impress when the interviewer asks this question: First, keep your answer work-related when answering, \u201c<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/tell-me-about-yourself-interview-question-answer/\">Tell me about yourself.</a>\u201d While technically they\u2019ve left it open to include personal details, it\u2019s not what the typical interviewer is looking for. And to keep your answer clear and easy to understand, tell your story in chronological order. Walk them through your background, starting with how you began your career or your current line of work. If you\u2019re a recent graduate or entry-level candidate, you can discuss your academic work. Why did you choose this field of study? What projects have you done and what have you worked on? If you have prior work experience, walk the interviewer through your key accomplishments, key career moves you\u2019ve made and why, and end by sharing what you\u2019re looking to do next in your career and why you\u2019re job hunting.</p>\n<p><strong><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Do:</span></span></b></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on sharing your professional story only</li>\n<li>Keep your answer under 2 minutes in length</li>\n<li>Walk them through how you got started in your career, key moves you\u2019ve made, and then bring them up to speed on your current situation</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Don\u2019t:</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Share personal details</li>\n<li>Talk for more than 2 minutes</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Interview answer example:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u200b\u201cI started my career in Marketing after graduating with a <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/top-15-business-degree-jobs/\">Business degree</a> in 2013. I\u2019ve spent my entire career at Microsoft, receiving two promotions and three awards for outstanding performance. I\u2019m looking to join a smaller company now, and take on more leadership and project management.\u201d</em></p></blockquote>\n<h2>Watch:&nbsp; Top 40 Interview Questions</h2>\n<div class=\"mv-video-target mv-video-id-x067jlhd9k8sjwjqzm16\" data-video-id=\"x067jlhd9k8sjwjqzm16\" data-volume=\"70\" data-ratio=\"16:9\"></div>\n<h3>2. What do you know about our company?</h3>\n<p>This is one of the most <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/common-job-interview-questions/\">common interview questions to practice for</a>. You\u2019re very likely to hear it in an early-stage interview, especially a <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/phone-interview-questions-best-answers/\">phone interview</a>. In the sample answers below, you\u2019ll see that the goal is to show them you\u2019ve done your research and didn\u2019t apply to their company without knowing anything about them. If you don\u2019t seem like you know anything about them, you\u2019ll come across as desperate \u2013 somebody who will take any job they can find. And that\u2019s going to make you unattractive to any good employers out there. So when they ask, \u201c<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-do-you-know-about-our-company/\">what do you know about our company</a>?\u201d, your primary goal is to show you\u2019ve done your research or knew about their company before applying. If you do this, you\u2019ll be fine.</p>\n<p><strong><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Do:</span></span></b></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Research the company before the interview (on their website, their LinkedIn page, Google News, and more)</li>\n<li>The more creative you can be in your research, the better. Try to go <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/went-above-and-beyond/\">above and beyond</a> a basic scan of the company website if you want to give the best answer possible</li>\n<li>Understand what industry they\u2019re in, what they sell and how they make money</li>\n<li>Try to have some sense of their company size. Are they 100 employees? More than 10,000 employees? Etc.</li>\n<li>In your answer, explain what caught your interest or excited you about their firm and show that you\u2019re interested in their particular company, and why. The interviewer wants to know why you want their specific job even if they don\u2019t ask directly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Don\u2019t:</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Say you don\u2019t know anything</li>\n<li>Say facts that are incorrect or you aren\u2019t sure about (it\u2019s better to know one or two facts that you can say accurately, than five facts you\u2019re not sure of)</li>\n<li>Do the bare minimum of research and only cite a couple of basic facts from the company\u2019s website</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Interview answer example 1:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cFrom what I read, your company is one of the leaders in database and website security for large corporations. I read your list of clients on your website and saw multiple Fortune 500 companies mentioned, including Verizon and IBM. Beyond that, I recently had an informational interview with James from the Marketing team, after messaging him on LinkedIn, and he shared a bit about your <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-is-company-culture-how-to-improve-yours/\">company culture</a>; mainly, the emphasis on collaboration and open interaction between different departments and groups. That\u2019s something that sounds exciting to me and that I\u2019m hoping to find in my next job. Can you share more about how you\u2019d describe the company&nbsp;culture here?\u201d</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Interview answer example 2:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cI know you\u2019re one of the leaders in contract manufacturing for the pharmaceutical industry. I read two recent news articles as well and saw that you just finalized plans to build a new facility that will double your manufacturing capacity. One of my hopes in my current job search is to find a fast-growing organization that could take full advantage of my past experience in scaling up manufacturing operations, so I was excited to have this interview and learn more about the specific work and challenges you need help with from the person you hire for this role.\u201d</em></p></blockquote>\n<h3>3.&nbsp; How did you hear about the position?</h3>\n<p>When they ask <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/how-did-you-hear-about-this-position-answer/\">\u201chow did you hear about the position?\u201d</a> it\u2019s typically best to give an honest, direct answer. The interviewer is simply curious how you came to know about them and the general idea behind why you applied. They\u2019re curious how you\u2019re finding positions to apply to in general, too. If you found the job through a colleague, through researching employers online, <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/tools/job-search-websites/\">through a job board</a> or job posting, or any other common method, simply tell them the truth.</p>\n<p><strong><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Do:</span></span></b></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be clear, direct, and upfront</li>\n<li>Tell the truth unless it\u2019s something very embarrassing (for example, when I was much younger, my mother found me a job to apply for. That does *not* sound great, so I answered by saying that a friend saw the job posting and mentioned it to me. A white lie is okay when needed).</li>\n<li>Explain why the job interested you, if possible (e.g. \u201cI was excited to apply because ___\u201d)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Don\u2019t:</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Say you don\u2019t remember or don\u2019t know</li>\n<li>Sound unsure of yourself</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Good answer examples:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cI found the position while looking for jobs online\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cI heard about it from a colleague/friend\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cYour company was recommended to me by somebody I worked with in a previous job and had heard good things about your organization\u201d</em></p>\n<p><em>\u201cI saw the job posted on LinkedIn, and the position seemed interesting so I wanted to learn more\u201d</em></p></blockquote>\n<h3>4. Why did you apply for this position?</h3>\n<p>When they ask \u201c<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/why-did-you-apply-for-this-position/\">why did you apply for this position</a>?\u201d pick something specific that interested you. If you say you love their products, tell them why. That\u2019s the key to giving a convincing answer to this job interview question. Stay away from sounding like you\u2019re desperate, or that you want just any&nbsp;job. Yes, if you were laid off it\u2019s okay to say that, but then <strong>re-focus the conversation on exactly what you\u2019re looking for in the next opportunity and why you feel their company might have it.</strong></p>\n<p>You need to sound like you want the RIGHT job and that you\u2019re being picky. Employers won\u2019t hire you if you don\u2019t demonstrate that you want to work for them in particular. So it\u2019s best to appear picky and selective in your job search. That means being clear about what you want in your next role. Also, the best answers will stay away from negatives and complaints. Don\u2019t bad-mouth your current company or boss. Focus on the positives of the job you\u2019re applying for now.</p>\n<p><strong><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Do:</span></span></b></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make them feel like you\u2019re interested in them for a specific reason</li>\n<li>Show you\u2019ve done your research and understand what the job involves</li>\n<li>Phrase everything as a positive. Don\u2019t badmouth your current situation, just talk about what you hope to gain by coming to work for them (experiences, challenges, opportunities).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Don\u2019t:</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Say you just need a job in general</li>\n<li>Explain that you\u2019re unemployed and just need to find work</li>\n<li>Say you just need money or have bills to pay so you need to find work</li>\n<li>Badmouth your current boss or company or say anything that will make it look like you\u2019re leaving your current role on bad terms</li>\n<li>Sound desperate, or sound like you will take any job you can get and you don\u2019t care what it ends up being</li>\n<li>Mention any other personal reasons like \u201cI need to find a shorter commute.\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Example answer 1:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cSince beginning my career, I\u2019ve wanted to work for a larger organization in this industry, and I know you\u2019re one of the leaders in this space. I\u2019m very interested in your products/services, especially the mobile applications you\u2019re building recently, so I\u2019d be excited to come here and grow my skills with an organization like yours.\u201d</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Example answer 2:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cI\u2019ve heard great things about the work environment here from a few colleagues. And when I saw this job posting, it seemed to match my skills very closely. For example, I saw on the job description that you need somebody who\u2019s an expert in Java programming. This is what I focused on in both of my previous positions, and was even the focus of my academic work before graduating from university. I consider myself an expert in Java and it\u2019s a skill I hope to continue specializing in.\u201d</em></p></blockquote>\n<h3>5. Why are you looking to leave your current company?</h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re job searching while employed, this is one of the most important interview questions and answers to know. (And if you\u2019re job hunting while unemployed, make sure you <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/why-did-you-leave-your-last-job-answers/\">prepare to answer, \u201cWhy did you leave your last position?\u201d</a> instead.) Otherwise, the most important thing to do when they ask <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/why-you-want-to-leave-job/\">why you are looking to leave your current job</a> is to <strong>stay positive and never badmouth your current employer, boss, or even team members. </strong>Rather than complaining or talking badly about your situation, say that you\u2019re looking for <em>more</em> of something positive. What are you hoping to gain from a job change? Is your current boss a jerk? Say that you\u2019re looking for an environment with more leadership you can learn from.</p>\n<p><strong><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Do:</span></span></b></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sound positive and focus on what you want to gain by making a move</li>\n<li>Show gratitude for your current job (e.g. \u201cThis job has been great and I\u2019ve learned a lot in the 2 years I\u2019ve been here, but I feel I\u2019m ready for ___ now.\u201d)</li>\n<li>Sound like you\u2019re ambitious, motivated, and eager to find the next challenge in your career.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Don\u2019t:</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Badmouth your current employer in any way</li>\n<li>Sound like you\u2019re trying to escape a bad situation, or you\u2019re failing or not fitting in at your current job</li>\n<li>Say you\u2019re struggling or failing to perform the work</li>\n<li>Say it\u2019s too difficult or stressful</li>\n<li>Say you\u2019re not sure</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Good sample answer:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cI\u2019m looking for more leadership opportunities. I\u2019ve been at my company for three years and have really enjoyed the experience but I feel in order to take the next step in my career, it\u2019d be helpful to join a larger organization and use what I\u2019ve learned in the past to lead more projects. That\u2019s why this <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/careers-project-manager/\">Project Manager</a> role excited me.\u201d</em></p></blockquote>\n<h3>6. Tell us about a challenge you\u2019ve faced and how you handled it</h3>\n<p>Focus on a specific work-related challenge and talk about how you overcame obstacles, used it as a learning experience, used the resources around you (including people/colleagues if applicable), and ended up with a positive result! That\u2019s how to answer this interview question. Keep it work-related, not personal.</p>\n<p><strong><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Do:</span></span></b></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Explain the situation, the task you needed to accomplish, and what method you chose (and why)</li>\n<li>Share the outcome. What was the result?</li>\n<li>Share what you learned from the experience. Did you take away knowledge that has helped you in your career?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Don\u2019t:</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Share any story that involves personal conflicts, arguments, or disagreements at work</li>\n<li>Talk about an argument you had</li>\n<li>Talk about a challenge that you didn\u2019t overcome, or didn\u2019t find a solution for</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Answer example:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cIn my last job, we were facing a tough deadline and my boss was out for the day. Our client was expecting a project to be delivered by 5:00 PM, but we were far behind schedule. I took the lead on the project and delegated tasks to the four other team members in a way that I thought would utilize everyone\u2019s strengths best. And then I reorganized my own personal tasks so I could dedicate my entire day to contributing to this project as well. The project was a success and we delivered the work on time. I went on to lead more projects after that</em><em>, and used what I learned to be a better project manager.\u201d</em></p></blockquote>\n<h3>7. How much money are you looking to earn?</h3>\n<p>This question is left off of many lists of common job interview questions, yet it\u2019s extremely important and the wrong answer can cost you thousands of dollars. The best answers to this question follow one rule: DON\u2019T say a specific number or even a narrow salary range that you\u2019re targeting. Why? You have the least amount of leverage possible at this point in the job interview and job search process. You haven\u2019t finished interviewing with this employer, and they don\u2019t even know if you\u2019re a good fit for the position. <strong>So you can\u2019t command a high salary right now. There\u2019s nothing to gain by answering salary questions so early, and quite a bit to potentially lose. </strong>If you go too low with your <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/best-answers-desired-salary/\">desired salary</a> range, it could limit the offer you receive later, even if they would have offered more normally. Or, you could worry them that you\u2019re not at the level they were hoping for! Meanwhile, if you share a number or range that\u2019s too high, you could scare them off before they get to know you and see your worth! Whereas, after talking with you in a few interviews, they might have been willing to stretch their budget to hire you! I\u2019ve seen this happen frequently as a recruiter.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it\u2019s a lose-lose to tell them your salary target before you know they\u2019re interested in hiring you. When you\u2019re preparing what to say in a job interview, especially an early-stage interview, salary goals should not be a part of it! You can, however, share some basic research you\u2019ve done into broad salary ranges for this type of position in your city.</p>\n<p><strong><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Do:</span></span></b></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell them that you\u2019re focused on finding the best-fitting role, and that you don\u2019t have a specific target salary in mind yet</li>\n<li>Repeat this multiple times if needed (if they pressure you or \u201cpush back\u201d after your first response)</li>\n<li>Share any research that you\u2019ve done into broad salary ranges for your type of role, but only provide a broad range (for example, a range of $50K \u2013 $75K).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Don\u2019t:</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell them a specific salary you\u2019re targeting</li>\n<li>Tell them a narrow range you\u2019re targeting</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Example answer:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cRight now I\u2019m focused on finding a job that\u2019s the right fit for my career. Once I\u2019ve done that, I\u2019m willing to consider an offer you feel is fair, but I do not have a specific number in mind yet. My priority in my job search is to find a position that\u2019s a great fit and will allow me to continue learning and becoming more skilled. That said, I did some baseline research into salaries for this type of role here in Seattle and found that the average seems to be in the $50K to $75K range, so if your job is within that range, I think it makes sense to keep talking.\u201d</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>For more info, here\u2019s a full article on <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/best-answers-desired-salary/\">how to answer desired salary on applications and interviews</a>.</p>\n<h3>8. Why should we hire you?</h3>\n<p>Employers ask, <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/interview-question-why-should-we-hire-you/\">\u201cWhy should we hire you\u201d</a> to see how well you understand the role, and to hear your perspective on how your skills can help them. When you hear interview questions like this, you should be thinking about their role, their needs, and how you\u2019ll help them. How will they benefit if they hire you? What will you improve for them? What will become easier, more efficient, or more profitable? And show you\u2019ve done your research. Make it clear that you know what this position involves and that you\u2019re ready to perform those exact tasks in your next job.</p>\n<p><strong><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Do:</span></span></b></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be confident in your skills and abilities</li>\n<li>Talk about specific things you can help them do or achieve if they hire you</li>\n<li>Do your research before the interview and understand their needs, so you can \u201ctailor\u201d your answers and target the specific things they\u2019ll need if they hire you in this role</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Don\u2019t:</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d</li>\n<li>Say \u201cYou should hire whoever you want\u201d</li>\n<li>Give a generic answer that\u2019d fit any company. You really need to \u201ctailor\u201d this to the specific duties you\u2019ll be performing in THIS specific job. Otherwise your answer will not impress them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Example interview answer:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cI read on the job description that you\u2019re looking for someone with experience in ____. I\u2019ve done that for 3 years and can immediately help you accomplish ____\u201d.</em></p></blockquote>\n<h3>9. Why do you want to work here?</h3>\n<p>If they ask \u201c<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/interview-questions-why-do-you-want-this-job-best-answer/\">why do you want this job</a>?\u201d show you\u2019ve done plenty of research to learn about them before coming in to interview. You want to make them feel like you chose them for a reason. This is very similar to the previous question: \u201cWhy did you apply for this position?\u201d Show them that you know what their job involves (at least as much as you could learn from the job description and company website) and that you\u2019re excited to be interviewing for this position. The bottom line is: The typical employer looks to hire someone who will want to work for them in particular, not just someone who wants to work any job they can find.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s how to demonstrate that you want to work for them and that you\u2019re a good fit when you answer:</p>\n<p><strong><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Do:</span></span></b></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mention specific, work-related reasons why their job and company interest you</li>\n<li>Talk about your own career path and goals, and how this job and company fits your future aspirations</li>\n<li>Sound excited about the opportunity to work for them</li>\n<li>Show you\u2019ve done your research</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Don\u2019t:</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Say, \u201cI have bills to pay and need money\u201d</li>\n<li>Say, \u201cI just need a job\u201d.</li>\n<li>Share any personal details like, \u201cI live 5 minutes away so it would be a very short commute\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sample interview answer:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cI\u2019ve been actively searching for jobs since graduating with my <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/top-15-nursing-degree-jobs/\">Nursing degree</a>. I\u2019m interested in intensive care and emergency medicine and I\u2019ve seen your hospital mentioned as having one of the best emergency departments in the region. I thought the job description matched up well with my background, and saw some of my <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-are-your-greatest-strengths-interview-answer/\">personal strengths</a> mentioned, like multitasking and being able to thrive in a fast-paced environment, so I\u2019d love to begin my career here.\u201d</em></p></blockquote>\n<h3>10. Why did you leave your last job?</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of good answers to this interview question. There isn\u2019t just one \u201cright\u201d answer. Here are some guidelines: If you chose to leave on your own terms, stay positive and focus on what you wanted to gain from the decision, rather than bad-mouthing or focusing on negatives you wanted to avoid. And if you were fired or laid off, be upfront and clear. You\u2019re not going to make employers want to hire you by being vague or trying to hide something. If you got fired, show what you\u2019ve learned from the experience, and what you\u2019ve done to make sure this doesn\u2019t happen again. That\u2019s how to spin it into a positive.</p>\n<p><strong><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Do:</span></span></b></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be clear and direct and address the question head-on</li>\n<li>If you were fired, own up to it and share what you\u2019ve done to make sure this never happens again</li>\n<li>If you chose to resign, focus on the positive things you hoped to gain by moving to the next opportunity, rather than badmouthing or talking about the negatives in your last role</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Don\u2019t:</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don\u2019t badmouth or complain</li>\n<li>Never say you resigned because of a disagreement or argument with a coworker</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t make it sound like money is your main priority</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t try to hide facts or avoid the question; this will just lead to more questions and suspicion from the interviewer</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Example answer:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cI was hired for a project management role, but over time that changed and I was no longer being given the opportunity to do the work I was interested in.

What is your greatest weakness?</h3>\n<p>When they ask, <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/whats-your-greatest-weakness-interview-question/\">\u201cwhat\u2019s your greatest weakness?\u201d</a> you want to name a real weakness. I recommend picking something skill-based, not personality-based. You never want to say you struggle to work with others, or you\u2019re bad at resolving disagreements, or taking direction from a manager, etc. Those things will get you <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/signs-interview-went-badly/\">rejected in the interview</a>. So pick a specific skill, but<strong> pick something that won\u2019t severely impact your ability to do this job.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>For example, if the job involves data entry with Excel spreadsheets all day, you do not want to say Excel is your weakness. Or that you struggle to pay attention to details. Finally, end your answer by explaining what you\u2019re doing to overcome or improve your weakness.</p>\n<p>Take a look at the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts and the interview answer example below to get a sense of what the best answers will sound like.</p>\n<p><strong><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Do:</span></span></b></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name a real weakness</li>\n<li>Pick something skill-based, not personality-based. For example, say, \u201cI\u2019m not particularly strong in Microsoft Excel\u2026\u201d rather than, \u201cMy weakness is working on a team and following directions.\u201d</li>\n<li>Mention what you\u2019ve done to overcome this weakness and improve recently</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Don\u2019t:</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Don\u2019t give a fake weakness like, \u201cI work too hard\u201d</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t try to be funny with an answer like, \u201cKryptonite.\u201d Hiring managers have heard it over and over</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t tell them you have no weaknesses</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t name a personality-based weakness (like \u201cI have trouble getting along with colleagues\u201d)</li>\n<li>Don\u2019t name a weakness that will severely impact your ability to succeed in their job</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Example interview answer:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cI\u2019m not particularly strong in <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/social-media-influencer/\">social media</a> marketing. For the first few years of my career, I focused entirely on email marketing. That\u2019s still what I specialize in, which is why I applied for your Email <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/marketing-manager/\">Marketing Manager</a> job. But I\u2019ve realized it\u2019s also helpful to understand the principles of social media marketing because some of the strategies that work there also work well in email. So I\u2019ve started spending a couple of hours per week of my own time to study and learn this new area, which has helped me a lot.\u201d</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>Note that you the interviewer might also ask, <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-do-you-need-to-improve-interview-question/\">\u201cwhat areas need improvement?\u201d</a> In that case, you can use the same approach, and I still recommend naming one single weakness, just to keep your answer simpler and more concise.</p>\n<h3>12. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</h3>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p><strong>\u200b\u200b</strong>There are three big reasons interviewers ask \u201c<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/where-do-you-see-yourself-in-5-years/\">where do you see yourself in 5 years?</a>\u201c:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\u200bThey want to see if you\u2019ve thought about your professional future</li>\n<li>They want to make sure you\u2019re ambitious and hard-working</li>\n<li>They want to make sure the job they\u2019re offering fits your goals</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, pick a work-related goal of where you\u2019d like to be five years from now, and make sure it\u2019s slightly challenging or ambitious-sounding. You don\u2019t want to say, \u201cI see myself in the same position five years from now.\u201d And make sure to share a goal that is related to the type of job you\u2019re interviewing for. You want to sound like the experience you\u2019ll gain in this job fits your long-term goals. Otherwise, they\u2019re going to be scared to hire you. Why would they offer you the job if it doesn\u2019t fit the goals you described to them? You\u2019d be unsatisfied, bored, and would probably quit within the first year. No company wants this.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Do:</span></span></b></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Show you\u2019ve thought about this topic and question</li>\n<li>Sound ambitious and motivated</li>\n<li>Be realistic.

They won\u2019t hire you for a job that has nothing to do with your 5-year goal</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Don\u2019t:</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be sarcastic or give a joke answer like, \u201cI plan on having your job\u201d</li>\n<li>Say you\u2019re not sure, or say you\u2019d be happy staying in the same role for five years (most companies do not want to hear this)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Example interview answer:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cI\u2019m glad you asked. In five years I see myself taking on more responsibilities, either through management or higher-level individual contributions. I\u2019m not sure which path will make sense to pursue, but I know my goal right now is to build a strong foundation and gain valuable experience so that I\u2019ll have a successful future in this industry.\u201d</em></p></blockquote>\n<p>They may also ask, \u201cWhat are your career goals\u201d so prepare to answer that, too. You can <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-are-your-career-goals/\">read career goal examples here.</a></p>\n<h3>13. Tell me about a time you failed</h3>\n<p>This is one of the most common interview questions in many fields, from <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/15-most-common-retail-interview-questions-and-answers/\">retail</a> to corporate positions, and is intended to find out if you\u2019re able to learn from mistakes and bounce back when things don\u2019t go your way. Employers want to see if you can own up to your mistakes, be accountable, and also learn and improve from the experience. That last piece is key if you want to give a good answer to this question.</p>\n<p>When you answer, <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/time-when-you-failed/\">\u201ctell me a time when you failed\u201d</a>\u2026 here are the most important do\u2019s and don\u2019ts to follow:</p>\n<p><strong><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Do:</span></span></b></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Admit to a real failure</li>\n<li>Describe the situation and what went wrong</li>\n<li>Show that you take responsibility (rather than blaming others), and show you learned from it</li>\n<li>Ideally, talk about how you used that lesson to get a different outcome next time you were presented with a similar challenge (e.g. how you turned a past failure into a future success)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Don\u2019t:</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Say you never fail</li>\n<li>Talk about a failure but then blame others and talk about how it wasn\u2019t really your fault</li>\n<li>Give a long-winded answer that goes off-track. You really need to be concise and show you can tell a clear story. That\u2019s one more thing employers look for when they ask this interview question.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sample interview answer:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cIn my most recent position, I had recently been promoted to Supervisor and was managing the department by myself right before the close of business. An employee was acting out and I confronted him in front of everybody. It made the situation worse and caused a lot of distraction for everyone on the floor. I failed to lead properly in this situation, and spoke to my manager the next day to discuss what I could have done better. We both agreed that I should have handled this privately with the employee by asking them to step inside my office. If I had done this instead of reacting the way I did, the situation would have turned out much better. From that point onward, I am always conscious of whether a discussion with a team member should occur in public or behind closed doors, and it made me a better leader.\u201d</em></p></blockquote>\n<h3>14. How do you make decisions?</h3>\n<p>This is another one of the most common interview questions you\u2019ll hear.&nbsp; You may also hear this phrased as a <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/20-behavioral-interview-questions-and-answers/\">behavioral interview</a> question, like, \u201cTell me about a time you had to make a difficult decision. How did you handle it and what did you decide?\u201d With any of these decision-making job interview questions, hiring managers want to know that you\u2019ve made good decisions in the past and are comfortable making a tough decision under pressure. Demonstrate this, and they\u2019ll feel more confident that you\u2019ll be able to make good decisions in your next job, too\u2026 while working for them.</p>\n<p>So to show the hiring manager that you\u2019re the right fit, prepare to explain how you organize and structure your decisions. The best answers will show that you\u2019re calm and follow a logical system when you <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/how-do-you-make-decisions-interview-question/\">make important decisions</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer sample 1:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cJust last week I had a situation that describes my process pretty well. One of our largest clients was having an issue with our latest software update and I had to decide between doing a fresh install on their system or trying to troubleshoot. The fresh install would come with downtime, but it was a known variable. Whereas, if we took troubleshooting steps, it could resolve the problem eventually, but the company would be working with multiple software bugs and issues for an unknown period. I spoke to our representative from their company, and also spoke to the <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-is-an-account-manager-and-how-to-become-one/\">Account Manager</a> within our firm who had originally brought this client on, since he had the closest relationship with the firm. The company didn\u2019t express a preference and told us that we should decide what\u2019s best. However, the Account Manager I spoke with said that this company is typically risk-averse and doesn\u2019t like uncertainty. They want to know how bad the \u201cdamage\u201d will be whenever a problem arises. Based on this information, I felt the best way to resolve the situation was to do a complete reinstall of the software, causing 30 minutes of downtime, but solving the problem that day. I also spoke to our billing team to provide a special discount to help offset the lost revenue our software caused, which the company appreciated and thanked me for.\u201d</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>Answer sample 2:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cI typically list out all available options and then weigh the pros and cons and expected outcomes of each. If other teams or people are impacted by the decision, I\u2019ll ask for their thoughts, too. Sometimes a peer will point out a pro or con that I hadn\u2019t seen, so I find it helpful to talk to others when appropriate. After this, I\u2019ll choose the course of action that I feel is most likely to bring about the best outcome. I also weigh the risks of each possible decision. If one decision has a good potential outcome but comes with too much risk for the company, then it may not be the right choice. Would you like me to give an example? Or did that answer your question\u2026\u201d</em></p></blockquote>\n<h3>15. What is your greatest achievement?</h3>\n<p>You shouldn\u2019t brag <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/tell-me-about-yourself-interview-question-answer/\">about yourself</a> in every interview question and answer, but sometimes it\u2019s called for. And this is one of those cases. Don\u2019t be timid and don\u2019t hold back. This is your chance to share one accomplishment that you\u2019re most proud of and why. I recommend choosing a professional achievement, but if the biggest win that comes to mind is personal, that\u2019s fine too. Ideally, share a story that illustrates how you overcome a challenge, went through a transformation, or overcame doubt or fear to accomplish something that you\u2019re proud of. If you can show determination and resiliency, that\u2019s going to impress most employers. However, there are plenty of scenarios where <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/greatest-achievement-interview-question/\">your biggest achievement</a> might show other traits instead. That\u2019s fine, too.</p>\n<h3>16. What are your leadership experiences?</h3>\n<p>Even if you\u2019re not directly interviewing for a management role, you may face some <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/leadership-interview-questions/\">leadership interview questions. </a>Employers like a candidate who can take initiative and lead projects and tasks even if it\u2019s not their main role to lead. Plus, that shows you\u2019ve got room to grow and can be promoted in the future.&nbsp; So before any interview, think about one or two recent <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-are-your-leadership-experiences/\">leadership experiences</a>, ideally from work situations. Did you lead any meetings or projects? Did you train or mentor anyone? Did you spearhead a new initiative at work? If you have no examples from work, then look to university experience, sports, or other clubs/activities where you led a project, task, meeting, or event.&nbsp; Note that you may also be asked, <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-is-your-leadership-style-interview-question/\">\u201cwhat is your leadership style?\u201d</a> but this is typically reserved for positions where you\u2019ll be leading as a core part of your role.</p>\n<h3>17. How would you describe yourself?</h3>\n<p>While this question is similar to, \u201cTell me about yourself,\u201d it\u2019s best answered with a shorter response. To prepare, pick two or three key positive adjectives that you\u2019d use to <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/describe-yourself-interview-question/\">describe yourself and your work</a>, and be ready to explain why.</p>\n<p><strong>Example answer:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p>I would describe myself as careful and hard-working. I\u2019m persistent, and my work ethic is something I take pride in. But I also like to work carefully and ensure that I\u2019m not committing mistakes or having to redo my work. I\u2019ve found that by slowing down and working carefully and methodically, you can often save yourself a lot of time and hassles in the long run.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>18. What are you passionate about?</h3>\n<p>Employers like to hire a candidate who has interests, passions, etc. This is also why companies often ask, <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-motivates-you/\">\u201cwhat motivates you?\u201d</a> or, \u201cwhat gets you out of bed in the morning?\u201d When <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-are-you-passionate-about/\">answering, \u201cwhat are you passionate about?\u201d</a> you have a lot of freedom. The question is very open-ended. I recommend naming one single area. This keeps everything simple and makes it easier to prepare. That\u2019s why I recommend it for multiple interview questions and answers above, too. So pick one topic that gets you really excited. It can be mission-oriented, like solving a crisis or helping the world. Or it can simply be that you enjoy challenges at work, learning, improving, problem-solving, reaching new levels of skill, etc. You can also share a personal story explaining how you got into your field of work or why it matters to you.&nbsp; No matter what you choose, pick one thing, and tell the truth. There isn\u2019t one \u201cright\u201d answer here but employers can tell if you\u2019re being genuine/honest, and that\u2019s what they want to see.</p>\n<h3>19. Do you want to tell us anything else about yourself?</h3>\n<p>As you reach the end of the job interview, the employer may ask, <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/anything-else-about-you/\">\u201cdo you want to tell us anything else?\u201d </a>When you hear this, you have two choices. First, if you feel the interview went well and you don\u2019t have anything else to add, it\u2019s completely fine to say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cNo, I think we covered the important topics here. I\u2019m satisfied if you are. I\u2019m looking forward to hearing your feedback, though, and the role sounds exciting to me.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>This is normal/acceptable and you shouldn\u2019t feel pressure to say more if you\u2019re satisfied that <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/signs-interview-went-badly/\">the interview went well.</a> This is <em>not</em> a trick interview question. </strong>However, if there is a topic you wish they had asked about but didn\u2019t, or <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-sets-you-apart/\">something unique that sets you apart from other candidates</a> that you didn\u2019t explain yet, then feel free to share it. They\u2019re giving you the opportunity because they genuinely want to know. You can also give yourself the opportunity to share a final point even if they don\u2019t ask. Just say, \u201cIs it alright if I share one more detail? Something came to mind and I think it\u2019s relevant.\u201d 99% of interviewers will say, \u201cYes, sure!\u201d</p>\n<h3><b>20.

Savvy interviewers may be on the lookout for how desperate you really are, so be prepared and try to maintain your composure.</span></p>\n<p><strong><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Do:</span></span></b></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re employed, express your imperative to honor your existing contracts, providing notice where notice is due.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you must consider options, say so.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re unemployed, it\u2019s best to allow some time and say you\u2019ll start in a week or a few days, otherwise, you\u2019ll seem too desperate, and tricky employers might take advantage.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Don\u2019t:</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t say you\u2019ll start immediately if you need to provide notice at your current job, as potential employers will frown on how easily you dishonor your contracts.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t provide a start date if you\u2019re still considering options.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t show your desperation by offering to start the next day, as this may lose you the power to negotiate higher rates, benefits, and more, down the line.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019ll only give notice at my current work when I know for sure that I\u2019ve found a more suitable alternative. Since my notice period is two weeks, I\u2019d only be able to start at the beginning of the third week after the new role is confirmed.\u201d</span></i></p></blockquote>\n<h3><b>35. What will you do if you don\u2019t get this position?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interviewers ask \u201cWhat will you do if you don\u2019t get this position?\u201d to gauge both your eagerness and your attitude to professional disappointment. It\u2019s a rare question, but it does come up. This is an opportunity to show your maturity and professionalism, but it\u2019s also a chance to express your earnest desire to be hired for the role.</span></p>\n<p><strong><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Do:</span></span></b></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Explain that you\u2019ll request feedback and review the experience to determine why you weren\u2019t selected for the role and, if there\u2019s for improvement, you\u2019ll make the necessary changes. Explain that you\u2019ll continue to apply to similar roles, as this is exactly the type of job you see yourself thriving in.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Don\u2019t:</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t say that you\u2019ll be devastated and inconsolable \u2013 show maturity.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t say that you\u2019ll just brush it off and carry on, as this will give the impression that you\u2019re not invested in this role or the role type.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt I\u2019ll be disappointed. However, I\u2019ll be constructive about it and ask whether there is any feedback you can offer to help me understand where I need to improve. I\u2019ll work on those skills and ensure I don\u2019t make the same mistakes when I interview for similar jobs in the future.\u201d</span></i></p></blockquote>\n<h3><b>36. Can you describe your work style?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An interviewer will ask \u201c<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/describe-work-style/\">Can you describe your work style?</a>\u201d for various reasons. They want to know how self-aware you are and whether you even have a style at all, but they also want to know whether your work style aligns with their needs and existing team dynamics. Your work style will offer insight into your overall work ethic, telling employers whether you\u2019re a hard worker, whether you\u2019re organized, and whether you\u2019re proactive.</span></p>\n<p><strong><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Do:</span></span></b></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indicate that you like to keep things organized and goal-driven and that you\u2019re versatile enough to take instruction, collaborate, or work on your initiative.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research the role in depth to ensure that the work style you describe aligns fully with the role requirements.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Don\u2019t:</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t try to be too unique, as employers will be on the lookout for tried and tested work styles that reveal your proactive, goal-driven nature, or indicate that you\u2019d fit well with their existing team.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;Don\u2019t describe a style that\u2019s ill-suited to the role.&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m very goal and detail-oriented, so I\u2019m determined to meet deadlines and briefs but not at the expense of the details. As a result, I have to work systematically, incrementally, and with a recurring cycle of hard focus and review \u2013 so I don\u2019t miss anything.\u201d&nbsp;</span></i></p></blockquote>\n<h3><b>37. Do you work well with other people?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interviewers ask the \u201cDo you work well with other people?\u201d question to determine whether or not you\u2019ll be able to collaborate, communicate and overcome potential challenges in a team setting. Most roles involve a certain level of human interaction, while some are dependent on advanced collaborative skills such as leadership, incorporating feedback, and accepting compromise.</span></p>\n<p><strong><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Do:</span></span></b></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try to answer in the positive, but if you prefer working alone you should say so and explain why.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;Even if you\u2019re not used to working in a team, you should show that you\u2019re excited about the opportunity to collaborate and engage with a team.&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Don\u2019t:</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t say things that will make you seem difficult, inflexible, socially inept, or antisocial.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t be vague, instead, try to show your aptitude for specific interactive skills even if you\u2019re not great at all of them.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAbsolutely, I\u2019ve thrived in collaborative open offices as well as Agile workspaces. I\u2019m very focused and professional but I find that my creative and innovative drives do best when I\u2019m bouncing ideas off others and discussing diverse perspectives.\u201d</span></i></p></blockquote>\n<h3><b>38. What should I know that\u2019s not on your resume?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interviewers ask questions like \u201cWhat should I know that\u2019s not on your resume?\u201d to break through the mask of professionalism that we all wear in an interview. In some cases, this it\u2019s designed to catch you off your guard, as it shows the hiring manager how you overcome challenges and awkwardness, giving them a glimpse of who you are.</span></p>\n<p><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\"><strong>Do:</strong></span></span></b></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be honest about positive personal qualities, achievements, or habits that show who you really are.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be prepared for a few personal questions like this so that you can answer confidently and appropriately.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Focus on relevant strengths.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Don\u2019t:</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t share the most sordid or regrettable tale you can muster from the past, this isn\u2019t about reliving your darkest hours.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t overdo it, instead, be concise and strategic in your answer.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m fiercely competitive, but not so much with others as with myself. It\u2019s vital to me that I improve my skill and expand my knowledge daily, and I become quite unhappy if I feel I\u2019ve not progressed. If there are ever training, development, and promotional opportunities, you can count me in.\u201d</span></i></p></blockquote>\n<h3><b>39. Do you consider yourself successful?</b></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interviewers ask the \u201cDo you consider yourself successful?\u201d question because they\u2019re curious about your self-reflection, sense of ambition, and whether you\u2019re tough on yourself or just conceited. Yet, they\u2019re also genuinely curious about your past achievements and what your old habits say about your motivation to succeed.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><b><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #339966;\">Do:</span></span></b></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Success should be always on your mind if you\u2019re hard-working, ambitious, and driven, so prove it.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Show that you think about it and that, even if you\u2019ve achieved a measure of success, you consistently set goals towards which to strive.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span style=\"color: #993300;\">Don\u2019t:</span></span></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t say you haven\u2019t thought about it.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s okay to show confidence and pride in past successes, but you should balance it by admitting your room for improvement and greater success in the future.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sample Answer:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI don\u2019t yet consider myself as successful but I see my habits as successful. After the gap in my employment, I changed my mental, lifestyle, and work habits. My track record of wins since then tells me that the changes I made are positive. I\u2019m confident that if I keep using and adding positive habits, I\u2019ll be on the path to success.\u201d</span></i></p></blockquote>\n<h3>40. Do you have any questions for us?</h3>\n<p>If you don\u2019t ask good questions in each interview, you might be costing yourself job offers. Asking questions shows interest in the position and shows employers that you\u2019re looking for the right fit, not just any job. <strong>This will make them trust you more and want you more. </strong>You can ask about the work, the training, the challenges you\u2019d face, the overall direction of the company. Don\u2019t ask about salary, benefits, time off, or anything that isn\u2019t related to the work. Wait for them to bring it up, or until you know they want to offer you the position.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/unique-questions-to-ask-employers/\">Here are 27 unique interview questions to ask employers.</a></p>\n<p><strong>Example answer:</strong></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>\u201cYes, I have a couple of questions actually.

    "Powerful Job Interview Tips From a Recruiter: How to Pass an Interview": "<div class=\"inside-article\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t<p>If you think most hiring decisions are based on your experience and qualifications, then you better keep reading. <strong>Your&nbsp;resume gets you in the door, but how you interview determines&nbsp;whether you\u2019re offered the job.</strong></p>\n<p>This article will teach you proven job interview tips to help you pass a job interview and get the job you want. Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Part I: Job Interview Preparation Tips </strong>\u2013 everything to do <em>before</em> your interview</li>\n<li><strong>Part II: Interviewing Tips </strong>\u2013 the best strategies to use <em>during</em> your interview to stand out</li>\n<li><strong>Part III: Tips for After Your Interview </strong>\u2013 how to make sure you get the job offer <em>after</em> your interview is over</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are the best interview&nbsp;tips that I know, from close to 5 years <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/should-i-be-a-recruiter/\">working as a Recruiter</a>.</p>\n<p>After you finish this article, you\u2019ll know how to stand out from other job seekers and pass a job interview a majority of the time.</p>\n<h2>Part I: Job Interview Preparation</h2>\n<p>Each step below will prepare you for the actual interview. None of this is very time&nbsp;consuming but it will set you apart from everyone else applying for the job, making it easy for the company to decide who to hire (you!)</p>\n<p>Here are the basic interview preparation steps&nbsp;to remember.&nbsp;I\u2019ve put the estimated time next to each one.</p>\n<h3>1. Research the company (10 minutes)</h3>\n<p>Interviewers can tell when you\u2019ve&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/research-company-before-job-interview/\">done your research</a>, and they love seeing it. And if you haven\u2019t\u2026 it looks really bad, especially at the start of the interview when they ask things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/why-did-you-apply-for-this-position/\">Why did you apply for this position?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-do-you-know-about-our-company/\">What do you know about us?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/interview-questions-why-do-you-want-this-job-best-answer/\">Why do you want this particular job?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>So the start of the interview is your chance to make a great first impression. Walking in with zero knowledge of their business is one of the fastest ways to shoot yourself in the foot and <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/why-cant-i-find-a-job/\">NOT get hired</a>.</p>\n<p>It could even lead to them ending the interview early. That\u2019s one of the biggest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/signs-interview-went-badly/\">signs your interview went badly</a>, and you definitely want to avoid that (for example if you were told it would be a one-hour interview, and you finish in 25 minutes).</p>\n<p>So be ready to show them that you what they do, how they make money, who their typical customer or client is, etc. You\u2019re not expected to be an expert on their business, but know the basics.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can do this company research on the company\u2019s website, on their <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/social-media-influencer/\">social media</a> pages, and by searching Google. I also recommend finding one or two recent news stories to see what the company has done recently. To learn the latest on a company, try&nbsp;typing the company\u2019s name plus the word \u201cnews\u201d into your search bar.</p>\n<h3>2. Think of two reasons you\u2019re interested in the company (10 minutes)</h3>\n<p>Use the company research you\u2019ve done to come&nbsp;up with a business-related reason you\u2019re excited about them. It could be a new business model, new clients, new partnership, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>Actual example: </strong>I recently&nbsp;had a phone interview with a tech company that was built as a review/info website. They recently started handling transactions instead of sending the buyers out to other websites to complete the transaction. I read this in the news and mentioned it as an exciting&nbsp;development and a really good business move. The interviewer was&nbsp;extremely impressed that I had read the news, and understood the implications. &nbsp;Total time spent researching: less than 3 minutes.</p>\n<p>Along with one business reason, try to come up with a secondary reason too. Maybe&nbsp;community involvement. Or <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-is-company-culture-how-to-improve-yours/\">company culture</a>. Almost every company has a blurb about their culture on the website. Read it and mention what you read as a secondary reason for being interested.</p>\n<p>You\u2019ll seem extremely well-prepared and well-rounded for having two very different reasons.</p>\n<h3>3. Think of an explanation for why you\u2019re job searching (5 minutes)</h3>\n<p>Companies will often choose someone&nbsp;less talented if they also seem&nbsp;less risky or if their motivations make more sense. I\u2019ve seen it first-hand.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t lose out on a job to somebody with less skill than you. Prepare some legitimate reasons why you want to make a move (<strong>without talking negatively about your current employer</strong>). Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You\u2019ve accomplished ____ in your current role and you\u2019re ready for a new challenge</li>\n<li>Your&nbsp;company\u2019s direction has shifted and you feel it\u2019s time to join a new organization</li>\n<li>You\u2019re interested in a different type of product/service</li>\n<li>You\u2019re looking for a larger or smaller&nbsp;organization</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can get more specific based on your situation. These are general ideas. If you do a good job with this you can beat out applicants&nbsp;that have more experience than yourself, because they\u2019re not using these strategies most likely.</p>\n<p>If you are job searching while employed, here\u2019s a <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/interviewing-when-you-have-job/\">full article on interviewing when you have a job.</a></p>\n<p>And if you\u2019re unemployed right now, here are <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/why-did-you-leave-your-last-job-answers/\">20 good explanations for why you chose to leave your last job.</a></p>\n<h3>4. Prepare to talk about specific accomplishments</h3>\n<p>Most people go into their interview and make general statements and talk in very general terms. To set yourself apart, you want to prepare specific examples and talk about DETAILS. Facts, numbers and real accomplishments.</p>\n<p>Hint: this is true on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/wondering-what-to-put-on-a-resume-focus-on-numbers/\">your resume</a>&nbsp;also. You\u2019ll get far more interviews if you cram your resume with facts, figures and statistics instead of general statements like \u201cresponsible for handling customer requests\u201d.</p>\n<p>So when the hiring manager asks what you accomplished in your last job, or what you do each day, you should be ready to impress! This is not the time to hesitate or be unsure. Prepare ahead of time for this.</p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for your first job without any work experience, then think about accomplishments in your academic career \u2013 classes you\u2019ve taken, projects you\u2019ve completed, etc. That\u2019s your most relevant experience!</p>\n<h3>5. Get familiar with your resume (5 minutes)</h3>\n<p>This is one of the more important interview preparation tips, and one of the easiest. Glance over your resume if you haven\u2019t in a while. Be ready to explain past job changes in a positive light. If you left a job because your manager was horrible, say that you went to an organization that had more supportive management. It\u2019s all about how you phrase it. We\u2019ll look at more examples of how to deliver this in Part II coming up.</p>\n<p>Also think of a couple of challenges and accomplishments in your last 1-2 positions. <strong>Interviewers love specific&nbsp;examples of accomplishments.</strong></p>\n<p>That\u2019s it, you\u2019re done with Part I.&nbsp;At this point you\u2019ve already&nbsp;done more than 80% of job applicants, and you have good answers prepared for some of <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-say-in-a-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\">the most common interview questions</a>. Let\u2019s move on\u2026</p>\n<h2>Part II: Job Interview&nbsp;Tips</h2>\n<p>So, you\u2019ve mentally prepared yourself with the interviewing tips from Part I. Now let\u2019s talk about how to pass a job interview after it begins.</p>\n<h3>1. Prepare to describe your work history BRIEFLY</h3>\n<p>Most interviewers will ask you to give a quick walkthrough of your background at the start of the interview. That\u2019s why I mentioned reviewing your resume beforehand. This pre-interview step is commonly overlooked but it\u2019s one of my favorite job interview tips and is so easy to do!</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve prepared a good, brief narrative of your career, you can impress them right off the bat. What got you interested in this field? What have you accomplished recently?</p>\n<p>But it has to be concise. Nobody&nbsp;wants to hire somebody that rambles on or sounds scattered, and that\u2019s the biggest mistake people make with this relatively open-ended question.</p>\n<p>Spend most of your time on the recent portion of your career. Go through the beginning rather quickly. 2-3 minutes total should be your target.</p>\n<h3>2. Explain why you\u2019re interested in interviewing with them</h3>\n<p>After&nbsp;walking them through your resume, you\u2019ll probably be asked why you\u2019re looking to make a job change, and/or why you\u2019re interested in their company in particular. This is where the research you\u2019ve done pays off. You should already have two specific reasons for wanting to interview with their company.</p>\n<p>When explaining your reason for job searching in general,&nbsp;I mentioned one example of how to turn a negative into a positive in Part I. Here are 2 more examples:</p>\n<p>If your current company&nbsp;has no room for upward growth, say that you\u2019re looking for a job with more room for upward growth.&nbsp;If you don\u2019t like your coworkers, say you\u2019re hoping to find a team that\u2019s more collaborative.&nbsp;See the difference? You\u2019re saying the same thing without sounding negative.</p>\n<p>Whatever you say you\u2019re looking for,<strong> be prepared for them to ask why you can\u2019t get&nbsp;that in your current company.</strong> Just answer by saying that you don\u2019t think there\u2019s an opportunity to get this, and that you considered this before starting to look externally. Simple and easy. That should end the line of questioning.</p>\n<h3>3. Answering technical questions- don\u2019t freak out</h3>\n<p>After the basic questions, you\u2019ll get into the meat of the interview. The content and questions here will vary based on the job, but here\u2019s&nbsp;what you need to know about how to pass the job interview:</p>\n<p>A good interviewer will test your limits. Especially if it\u2019s a position involving some type of&nbsp;technical knowledge (math, science, engineering, etc). The only way they can find&nbsp;your limits is if they ask something you don\u2019t know. So&nbsp;stay calm when you get this. Here\u2019s what to do:</p>\n<p>Try to work your way through the question as much as you can. Your thought process is often more important than answering correctly, so tell them what you\u2019re thinking. Ask questions to clarify if needed.</p>\n<p>Seeming genuine, thoughtful and honest can go a long way. It\u2019s more important than answering any one question correctly.</p>\n<p>Preparing yourself for how you\u2019ll handle a question you\u2019re not sure of or didn\u2019t expect is an important piece of how to pass an interview. You can prepare for questions all day, but you still might hear something you weren\u2019t ready for.</p>\n<h3>4. Ask your own questions at the end</h3>\n<p>You should ask a lot of questions after the interviewer has finished their own questions.&nbsp;How are you going to decide if you want the job if you don\u2019t find out any info? The best job candidates are evaluating a company, not just trying to get a job in the first company that wants them. <strong>Once a company realizes this, they\u2019ll treat you like a top-notch candidate and try to sway you to join them.</strong></p>\n<p>If you aren\u2019t sure what to ask, here\u2019s a mega-list of the <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/questions-to-ask-the-interviewer/\">best questions to ask</a>.</p>\n<p>And here are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/5-good-questions-to-ask-a-recruiter/\">5 great questions to ask recruiters</a>&nbsp;in particular (this is for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/phone-interview-questions-best-answers/\">phone interviews</a>&nbsp;or first conversations with any <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/careers-recruiter/\">recruiter</a>).</p>\n<p>Use these lists to come up with questions to ask each person you\u2019ll be meeting. If you interview with 4 people, you should ask questions to all of them. It\u2019s okay to repeat a question, but don\u2019t tell the last person, \u201cso-and-so already answered all my questions.\u201d I\u2019ve done this in the past and wasn\u2019t offered the job. Lesson learned.</p>\n<p>Some of the best questions are opinion-based questions because you can ask the exact same question to as many people as you want. Example: \u201cWhat\u2019s your favorite part about working here? What&nbsp;is the biggest challenge/difficulty you face here?\u201d</p>\n<h3>5. Always act like you want the job</h3>\n<p>You have one goal in any interview: Convince them that you\u2019re the best candidate for the job and get invited to the next round.</p>\n<p>So you should be selling yourself in the interview, not deciding if the job is desirable.</p>\n<p>Then you can go digest the info and <a href=\"https://www.recruiter.com/i/5-warning-signs-you-shouldnt-take-the-job/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">make a decision once you get home</a>.&nbsp;If you start using this approach&nbsp;you\u2019ll have a&nbsp;big advantage throughout the entire interview because you\u2019ll have one single thing to focus on. Other applicants will be juggling everything at once.</p>\n<h3>6. Don\u2019t ask for feedback on the spot</h3>\n<p>I\u2019ve seen&nbsp;people recommend that you&nbsp;ask for feedback or concerns at the end of the interview. Something like this: \u201cBased on what we\u2019ve discussed, is there any reason you wouldn\u2019t consider me for this job?\u201d Horrible advice. Never ask this. Ever. Or anything like it.</p>\n<p>First of all, they just finished interviewing you. Give them time to think. You\u2019re going to go home and decide whether you\u2019re interested, they need time&nbsp;to think too. Don\u2019t put them on the spot like this.</p>\n<p>Also, you\u2019re bringing the negatives to their attention. You\u2019re literally asking them if they can think of a reason that\u2019d stop them from hiring you. Even if they do think of something, they won\u2019t tell you for fear of a lawsuit.</p>\n<p>I like to say something like this instead:&nbsp;\u201cIf you need any more info from me or have any questions later, don\u2019t hesitate to contact me.\u201d</p>\n<h3>7. Be human</h3>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to seem perfect in the interview to get hired. Don\u2019t try. Be human.</p>\n<p>If you seem fake, or if you try too hard to give \u201cperfect\u201d answers, the hiring manager might not be able to get a real sense of what your strengths and weaknesses are. And if they can\u2019t tell, they won\u2019t hire you.</p>\n<p>So, don\u2019t go in with <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-say-in-a-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\">interview answers</a> you read from the top of Google. If you found those in 5 minutes, everyone else did too. Come up with&nbsp;great answers that are unique.</p>\n<p>Remember that it\u2019s also okay to occasionally say, \u201cI\u2019m not sure\u201d, or \u201cSorry, I\u2019m drawing a total blank\u201d. (This is okay once or twice per interview. If you find yourself doing it more, it\u2019s a sign you didn\u2019t prepare enough).</p>\n<h3>8. Learn the interviewer\u2019s name and use it</h3>\n<p>I\u2019m horrible at remembering names. I always have been. So if I can do this, you can too\u2026</p>\n<p>When you hear someone\u2019s name, repeat it to yourself in your head once or twice IMMEDIATELY after you shake hands. This helps you remember it.</p>\n<p>Most of the time, if you forget someone\u2019s name, it\u2019s because you never really \u201cgot\u201d it. Immediately after you heard it, you forgot. So this is how to remember.</p>\n<p>Then, use it in the conversation within the first 5-10 minutes of the interview. Now you\u2019ll never forget it.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s another benefit to this too \u2013 using someone\u2019s name helps you build a bond with them and build trust. Studies have shown you seem more&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/show-confidence-interview/\">confident</a>, competent and impressive when you say someone\u2019s name when talking to them.</p>\n<p>Go talk to the <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/ceo-vs-coo-differences-in-roles-responsibilities-salaries/\">CEO</a> in your company, and I bet they\u2019ll use your name in the conversation. Leaders do this. Successful people do this.</p>\n<p>This is a very underrated tip for interview success that anyone can do. It just takes effort.</p>\n<p>You will build a stronger bond/rapport with the interviewer if you do this, and they\u2019ll be more likely to remember you favorably and hire you.</p>\n<h3>9. Be upfront and use clear language</h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t use vague language and \u201cdodge\u201d their questions. And don\u2019t lie. They\u2019ll usually know. Hiring managers interview a lot of people and have a great sense of this.</p>\n<p>If you lie and get caught, there is no way they\u2019re going to hire you.</p>\n<p>And if you seem like you\u2019re trying to hide information, they won\u2019t trust you and won\u2019t hire you either.</p>\n<p>Hiring managers aren\u2019t just evaluating your skill; they\u2019re evaluating your character. If you\u2019re going to be joining their team, they need to see what type of person you are. And&nbsp;<strong>no hiring manager wants someone who is dishonest on their team.</strong></p>\n<p>What do they want? Someone who stands up and takes responsibility when things go wrong, who can learn from past mistakes, who is honest if there\u2019s a problem, and who isn\u2019t afraid to tell the truth.</p>\n<p>The interview is where they test this before hiring you. So just remember that while they\u2019re judging your experience and skills, they\u2019re also judging these character traits.</p>\n<h3>10. Never badmouth</h3>\n<p>Don\u2019t badmouth former bosses, former employers, coworkers or anyone else.</p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what happens when you do: The interviewer will immediately become curious about the other side of the story. They\u2019ll wonder if you were part of the problem (or the whole problem).</p>\n<p>They\u2019ll want to know if you\u2019re someone who always looks to blame others. And they might worry that you have a bad attitude and won\u2019t be able to fit into their organization. And they won\u2019t hire you because of this.</p>\n<p>So never, ever badmouth anyone from your past in your interview. Also, you never know if the interviewer knows somebody who you\u2019re bad-mouthing! Many industries have pretty tight-knit communities.</p>\n<h3>11. Make everything about THEM</h3>\n<p>Here\u2019s a little secret: The interview isn\u2019t really <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/tell-me-about-yourself-interview-question-answer/\">about you</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to start getting a TON of <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/how-to-write-a-job-offer-letter-template-examples/\">job offers</a> from your interviews, you need to start thinking about what the company wants. Make yourself seem like a solution to their problems.</p>\n<p>How can you help them make money, save money, save time, etc.?</p>\n<p>How will you make the hiring manager\u2019s life easier if he or she hires you?</p>\n<p>Figure out how to show this, start thinking about their needs and answering their questions with this mindset and you will be in the top 10% of job seekers.</p>\n<p>The same goes for <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-put-on-resume/\">writing your resume</a>.</p>\n<p>If you want to stand out, start thinking of your resume as being about THEM. It\u2019s a document that should be \u201c<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/how-to-tailor-your-resume-for-each-job-description/\">tailored</a>\u201d to the employer\u2019s needs,&nbsp;<strong>showing them how your qualifications and past work will help you step into *their* job and be successful in their organization.</strong></p>\n<p>That\u2019s the general idea, and it\u2019s true for resumes, <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/cover-letters-that-get-noticed/\">cover letters</a>, and interviews.</p>\n<h2>Part III: Tips for After Your Interview</h2>\n<p>Once your interview is done and you\u2019ve left the room, there are still a few things you should do to boost your chance of getting a callback.</p>\n<p>These interview tips will help you impress the employer after the interview is over.</p>\n<h3>Always thank the interviewer</h3>\n<p>You want to thank your interviewer when you leave the room and send a <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/thank-you-note-after-interview/\">thank you email</a> the following day.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Showing appreciation for the employer\u2019s time goes a long way, and it\u2019s one of my favorite interview tips because it requires no talent; just effort.</p>\n<h3>Act interested but not desperate while waiting for feedback</h3>\n<p>Sometimes you won\u2019t hear from the employer for many days after your interview.</p>\n<p>They might need to meet more candidates, or might need time to finalize their decision.</p>\n<p>I\u2019d recommend wrapping up your interview by asking when you can expect to hear feedback. That way, you won\u2019t be too anxious waiting at home.</p>\n<p>If that time passes, it\u2019s okay to <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/follow-up-after-interview-no-response/\">follow up with the employer</a> to get an update from them. But be patient and never sound needy/desperate. Delays happen.</p>\n<p>If they tell you, \u201csorry, things are taking longer than we expected and we are still making our decision,\u201d the worst thing you can do is act frustrated or upset.&nbsp;This isn\u2019t going to help you get hired!</p>\n<p>The best thing you can do is keep applying for jobs while you wait. It\u2019s never smart to wait around for one single employer because so many unexpected things can cost you the job or cause a delay in the process.&nbsp; (Budgets change, people get promoted inside the company and they no longer need an external candidate, etc.)</p>\n<p>So that\u2019s another one of my favorite interview tips \u2013 when you finish one interview, try to get more lined up! Don\u2019t stop interviewing for jobs until you\u2019ve signed a job offer.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Use These Tips for How to Pass an Interview and Get More Job Offers</h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve followed these job interview tips, you\u2019re in great shape to pass your next interview and get the job offer.</p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget: Motivation, interest, and how you explain yourself and the reason you\u2019re interviewing are&nbsp;just as important as your actual resume/skillset.<strong> I can\u2019t stress this enough in terms of important job interview tips to remember!</strong></p>\n<p>Reading this article won\u2019t change your professional skills. But it can change something far more powerful \u2014 how you come across in the interview room.</p>\n<p>By using the interview tips and strategies above, you can beat out somebody with more experience and a more impressive resume because job interviewing is a separate skill\u2026 a skill that you\u2019ve spent time mastering.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-5db80e85\">\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-base-2-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-base-2-background-color has-background\">\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-0ec43197\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-2e6a8c4d\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-7b1c6b54\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-7b1c6b54\">\n<figure class=\"gb-block-image gb-block-image-8796466a\"><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/author/biron/\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='150'%20height='150'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Biron Clark\" class=\"avatar avatar-150 wp-user-avatar wp-user-avatar-150 alignnone photo gb-image-8796466a perfmatters-lazy\" data-src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Biron-Clark-uai-158x158.png\" data-srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Biron-Clark-uai-336x336.png 2x\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Biron-Clark-uai-158x158.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Biron-Clark-uai-336x336.png 2x\" alt=\"Biron Clark\" class=\"avatar avatar-150 wp-user-avatar wp-user-avatar-150 alignnone photo gb-image-8796466a\" /></noscript></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-6d502a65\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-6d502a65\">\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-aefdd19e gb-headline-text\"><strong>About the Author</strong></p>\n\n\n<div style=\"font-size:16px;\" class=\"wp-block-post-author-biography\">Biron Clark is a former executive recruiter who has worked individually with hundreds of job seekers, reviewed thousands of resumes and LinkedIn profiles, and recruited for top venture-backed startups and Fortune 500 companies.

    "38 Unique Interview Questions to Ask Employers": "<div class=\"inside-article\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t<p>Most job seekers ask the same generic questions in their interviews. And they\u2019re missing a big opportunity to impress the employer. As a former <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/careers-recruiter/\">recruiter</a>, I\u2019m going to share <strong>38 unique and creative questions that most other candidates aren\u2019t asking</strong> so you can impress the employer and land the position. Keep reading for 38 unique, \u201ckiller\u201d <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-say-in-a-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\">interview questions</a> to ask an employer.</p>\n<h2><b>Best Tips for Asking Unique Questions During a Job Interview</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asking unique questions is great in a job interview, but you should avoid some common mistakes. Follow these tips:</span></p>\n<h3><b>Do:</b></h3>\n<p><b>Prepare in Advance </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before your interview, brainstorm a list of questions that will help you learn more about the position, your future </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">coworkers</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and the company. Your interviewer will probably discuss the role at length. You may learn the answers to some of your questions during your discussion.</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p>\n<p><b>Ask Open-Ended Questions. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Open-ended questions can\u2019t be answered with a simple yes or no. When you ask open-ended questions, your interviewer can add details to their answer, which will help you learn more. You can use their response to follow up with additional questions, giving the conversation a natural flow.</span></p>\n<p><b>Focus on the Job. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep a laser focus on the job and the company. You\u2019ll want to demonstrate your genuine interest in the position, and there\u2019s no better way to do so than by asking questions relevant to the role. Follow up on any items that weren\u2019t completely clear during the interview.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Don\u2019t:</b></h3>\n<p><b>Ask Questions About Salary and Benefits.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There\u2019s no reason to discuss the company\u2019s salary or benefits plan in an initial interview. Your purpose is to learn about the position, the hiring manager, and the organization, which will help you decide whether the job suits you. Save conversations about compensation until they offer you the role.</span></p>\n<p><b>Ask Irrelevant Questions. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid asking questions about issues that don\u2019t pertain to the position. For instance, you don\u2019t want to bring up parking or nearby restaurants that serve lunch. Stick to inquiries that directly relate to the role or the organization.</span></p>\n<p><b>Ask Questions That Could Be Answered by Doing Basic Research About the Company. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t waste the interviewer\u2019s time by asking questions you can find in a simple Google search, such as how long the company has been in business or where their other office locations are. Instead, ask questions that allow you to learn more about the position.</span></p>\n<h2>Watch: Unique Questions to Ask Employers</h2>\n<div class=\"mv-video-target mv-video-id-ymaemp9zzcazss5eoopp\" data-video-id=\"ymaemp9zzcazss5eoopp\" data-volume=\"70\" data-ratio=\"16:9\"></div>\n<h2>1. What\u2019s one thing you\u2019re hoping a new person can bring to the role?</h2>\n<p>This is a creative, interesting question to ask employers, and as a former recruiter, I recommend it for a few reasons. First, this question shows that you\u2019re focused on coming into this company\u2019s role and helping them immediately. And it also shows that you\u2019re looking to come in and bring a new spark or new ideas, rather than just copying what everyone else is doing. Asking this question will quickly show the hiring manager or recruiter that you\u2019re smart, proactive, and different than the other candidates they\u2019ve seen.</p>\n<h2>2. What do the most successful people here do differently than everyone else?</h2>\n<p>This shows the hiring manager that you\u2019re thoughtful, different, and genuinely interested in being a top performer in this job. This will make them excited to hire you and will help differentiate you from other job seekers. This question shows them that you\u2019re focused on coming in and being successful\u2026 before they\u2019ve even offered you the job, which will help you get hired.</p>\n<h2>3. What does it take to be successful here?</h2>\n<p>This is similar to the question above in that it shows the employer that you\u2019re focused on finding success in their role. It demonstrates that you\u2019re not just trying to find a paycheck and be an average performer; you\u2019re aiming to be the best in your career. Hiring managers and other interviewers will love seeing these traits. It\u2019s relatively easy for employers to find someone with the basic skills to do a job, and they can determine that on your resume, but in the job interview, they\u2019re looking for more. And ideally, they would like to find someone who is coming in with a positive attitude and thinking ahead about how to be successful for the company; someone who\u2019s going to be working hard from day one. So, asking this question in your interview is going to make the hiring team a lot less worried <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/tell-me-about-yourself-interview-question-answer/\">about you</a> failing in the role, taking a long time to get \u201cup to speed,\u201d etc. And those are some of the biggest concerns that employers typically have about new employees.</p>\n<h2>4. What about my resume caught your attention for this position?</h2>\n<p>This is one of the more unique questions to ask the interviewer, and it will reveal what pieces of your background caught their attention. Then, you can make sure to discuss those pieces when&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-say-in-a-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">answering questions in the interview</a>. By understanding what grabbed the employer\u2019s attention in your background, you can hone in on those topics in the interview, share further info and examples of past success, or ask further questions like, \u201cIs there anything else you want to know on this particular topic?\u201d which invites them to continue discussing the topic and ask for more info about your background.</p>\n<h2>5. What are the top skills and traits you\u2019re targeting for this position?</h2>\n<p>This is another excellent, unique question to ask the interviewer, and most employers don\u2019t hear this often\u2026 if at all. This question focuses on their interview process and what they\u2019re thinking behind the scenes. It\u2019s a thoughtful, interesting question, and it\u2019s bold, too! It takes guts to ask this, so it\u2019ll grab the hiring manager\u2019s attention AND make them think a bit to give you a thoughtful response.</p>\n<p>Any time you can ask a question that makes the employer stop and think before they answer, it\u2019s a good thing!</p>\n<h2>6. What would success look like in the first 90 days?</h2>\n<p>This follows the pattern of a couple of the questions above \u2013 it shows them that you\u2019re focused on success in the role and already thinking ahead about how to be a big success for them! That\u2019s going to get them excited about you as a candidate because it shows them that you care about helping their company, not just getting paid.</p>\n<h2>7. How long has the job been open and where are you currently in the hiring process?</h2>\n<p>This is one of my favorite questions for an interviewer because it will provide you with valuable information about the hiring process and situation \u201cbehind the scenes.\u201d This can help you know what to expect as the process continues, and it\u2019s also an original question that most candidates aren\u2019t asking, so you\u2019ll stand out in the interview.</p>\n<h2>8. What are some traits that would make someone&nbsp;not&nbsp;a good fit for this role?</h2>\n<p>Most hiring managers don\u2019t get asked this (which is a good thing \u2013 for you!) Ask this question to show them that you\u2019re careful and thoughtful in your job hunt (which is the opposite of desperate) \u2013 and that you\u2019re looking for the&nbsp;<em>right</em> fit, not the first job offered to you.&nbsp;<strong>This is how to position yourself as a top-tier job candidate.</strong></p>\n<h2>9. Why did you say \u201cyes\u201d when the position you hold now was offered to you?</h2>\n<p>It\u2019s nice to ask at least one question to learn about the interviewer and their personal experience at the company. Everyone likes to talk about themselves, so most interviewers will be happy to share their experiences here. <strong>Also, since this is an opinion-based question, you can ask the same question to multiple people in the company.&nbsp; </strong>If you meet with three employees from a company, you can ask all three about this topic without looking bad in the interview. You should go into each interview with at least one opinion-based question like this, so you know you won\u2019t run out of things to ask (in case you meet more people than expected). And always make sure it\u2019s a creative question like the one above so you stand out.</p>\n<h2>10. What\u2019s the most challenging aspect of the role?</h2>\n<p>This question shows employers that you\u2019re realistic and ready for a challenge and that you realize it\u2019s not going to be comfortable at the beginning. It\u2019s also a relatively uncommon question that most job seekers don\u2019t ask the interviewer, so you\u2019ll get bonus points for being different. You could follow this question up by asking how the interviewer recommends overcoming the challenge to succeed in this position, too. That will impress them even more.</p>\n<h2>11. How would you describe your management style?</h2>\n<p>Ask this question to your potential next boss (not HR or a recruiter) to find out whether you\u2019ll enjoy working in this type of environment and under this type of management style. It\u2019s a thoughtful question that the typical company doesn\u2019t hear often, and it\u2019ll make the employer think before answering. That\u2019s always a good thing, especially since hiring managers are typically asked the same generic questions in the interview and don\u2019t have to think much about answering.</p>\n<h2>12. What are your biggest concerns about the department/team right now?</h2>\n<p>This is another question to ask the hiring manager in a job interview (not HR). It\u2019ll force them to think and be honest about the downsides of the job and company. You don\u2019t want to accept a job without knowing what you\u2019re getting into, right?</p>\n<h2>13. What are you hoping I\u2019d accomplish in the first year here?</h2>\n<p>You may not know where you see yourself in five years, but an employer at least wants to see that you\u2019re planning to stay with the company for a year or more. So consider asking a question about what the employer hopes you\u2019d do in the first year with them, and then what the second year would look like (including potential promotions, additional responsibilities, etc.) The best companies I\u2019ve worked for have been transparent and open about potential career tracks, long-term progression, and professional development opportunities after you join their organization. So this question will help you know how this employer treats their employees beyond the initial training period and into future years.</p>\n<h2>14. How often do you promote people internally?</h2>\n<p>The first recruiting agency I joined ONLY promoted people from within the company. That meant that if you wanted to be a Manager, you HAD to start as an entry-level Recruiter. Everyone began this way. This gave me fantastic opportunities as an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/find-job-without-work-experience/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">entry-level job seeker</a>&nbsp;myself (and I did end up&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/how-to-ask-for-a-promotion/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">getting promoted</a> to <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/careers-project-manager/\">Project Manager</a> eventually). So this is something I like to see in an organization and something you should ask questions to find out about. Most companies won\u2019t&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;promote from within, but you should look for some balance at least.</p>\n<p>You can also follow this up by asking the interviewer, \u201cHow would you describe the company\u2019s internal promotion process? What does an employee do if they\u2019d like to apply for a higher role in the company, and how are employees able to hear about these internal opportunities?\u201d</p>\n<h2>15. How do performance reviews work here?</h2>\n<p>Don\u2019t take a job without knowing what your performance review process will look like. It\u2019s important to know how often reviews (and <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/when-to-ask-for-raise/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pay raises</a>) are given, who decides whether your performance is satisfactory, which specific aspects of your work are graded, and more.</p>\n<p>This is one of the most&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/questions-before-accepting-job/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">important questions to ask before accepting a job</a>.</p>\n<h2>16. What have people gone on to do in the company after holding this position?</h2>\n<p>This is important to know for your future career growth, and asking this also shows the interviewer that you\u2019re goal-oriented and motivated. That will help you get more <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/how-to-write-a-job-offer-letter-template-examples/\">job offers</a>. Every company likes to see this in their candidates.</p>\n<h2>17. What has been your best experience working here?</h2>\n<p>This is another personality-based question, which means you can ask multiple people in your job interview. It\u2019s also unique and engaging and could spark a great conversation. Then, you can build more rapport and get to know the interviewer (always a good thing!)</p>\n<h2>18. What\u2019s the first problem or challenge the person you hire will need to tackle?</h2>\n<p>This question shows that you\u2019re coming in focused and ready to contribute from day one. It also shows that you\u2019re making sure to look for a position that you\u2019re well-equipped to handle. So you\u2019ll build trust with the company, and show them that you\u2019re a motivated candidate. That\u2019s a win-win. Plus, you\u2019re going to discover the company\u2019s biggest \u201cpain point\u201d in the interview so you can speak more about that topic and further demonstrate that you\u2019re ready to solve their problem.</p>\n<p>Or if you feel you already discussed the topic, you could say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great to hear since I\u2019ve done similar work at my past company and helped them solve this exact type of problem. I know we touched on that past work in this interview already, but is there anything else I can provide in terms of information on the topic? I\u2019m happy to share more if so.\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<h2>19. Does your company have any advantages over your competitors in the market?</h2>\n<p>Asking this in your job interview will show that you\u2019re a big-picture thinker and someone who is naturally curious and interested in the overall business. While most candidates are just asking about the role and day-to-day work (which you should, too, by the way), you\u2019re ALSO asking about something bigger/broader, to show that you\u2019re able to see the bigger picture and think at a higher level. That\u2019s a trait every hiring manager would like to see in a candidate</p>\n<h2>20. Have other people failed in this position, and why?</h2>\n<p>In your job search, it\u2019s a good idea to ask whether people have struggled in a role you\u2019re considering. The company\u2019s answer can give you valuable information about how to succeed if hired, but can also warn about a position with some potential red flags. For example, if a company says that each person they\u2019ve hired failed to learn the required skills, you\u2019d be smart to ask the interviewer about the training process and how much time each person was given to learn the role.</p>\n<p><strong>Your goal in an interview is to impress the hiring manager, but it\u2019s also important to gather info about the role and protect yourself from taking any bad jobs that will set you back in your career. </strong></p>\n<p>So an employer\u2019s answer to this question will provide you with valuable info to help with that. And since this is a question that most job seekers aren\u2019t asking, you\u2019ll set yourself apart and gain some bonus points for asking something different and creative in the interview.</p>\n<h2>21. How fast is the company growing?</h2>\n<p>This is another question that shows you\u2019re a big-picture thinker, and that you like to be aware of what\u2019s going on not just in your role and group, but also in the broader organization. It also shows that you\u2019re looking for a long-term move for your career, not just a place to stay for a few months and work. If you\u2019re interviewing for a full-time, permanent position (not contract, etc.) employers always want to see signs that you\u2019re planning on staying a long time in this new position. This is because employers have to put a lot of time, energy, and resources into hiring someone for a role. So ask this question in every job interview to show you\u2019re looking for a long-term career move, not just a new position that you can pay some bills with.</p>\n<h2>22. Who are your top competitors and why do people choose to work for you over them?</h2>\n<p>This is very similar to the question above \u2013 it shows a general interest in their company, industry, and how they fit with their competitors.</p>\n<p>One note: You should have more questions about the actual job\u2026 what you\u2019ll be working on, the challenges of the position itself, etc. Don\u2019t&nbsp;<em>only</em>&nbsp;prepare questions about the company overall. This could be a potential red flag \u2013 and make them worry that you like their company but aren\u2019t passionate about working in this individual role.</p>\n<h2>23. After I master the basics here, what opportunities are provided for continued learning and career growth?</h2>\n<p>Asking about professional development and long-term career outlook in a role is yet another way to show that you\u2019re goal-oriented while finding out valuable info to help you decide whether to accept or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/turn-down-job-offer/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">decline the job offer</a> if it gets to that point! Always ask at least one question about how the company will help you grow long-term. This is a killer interview question to ask the employer because they\u2019ll see that you\u2019re planning on staying with the company for a long time and planning on being highly successful in the role. This also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/show-confidence-interview/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">shows a lot of confidence in the interview</a>, which is always good.</p>\n<h2>24. What soft skills are most important in this role?</h2>\n<p>You can typically figure out what hard skills are required by looking at a job description, but it may be tougher to know what type of <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/soft-skills-to-succeed/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">soft skills</a> an employer wants. So I recommend asking them about this topic in the interview. Or, if it\u2019s already mentioned in the job description, you can ask a question like: \u201cI saw the job description lists a couple of <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/soft-skills-to-succeed/\">soft skills</a> that are needed for the position, like multitasking and excellent communication. I\u2019m confident about my abilities in those areas, but can you share how those would be used in the position and how strength in those areas would help me perform well?\u201d</p>\n<h2>25. Do your team members/employees get together outside of work hours?</h2>\n<p>This is an interesting question that will help you know how close the team is and whether they get together after work. If this type of thing doesn\u2019t matter to you when selecting a position, then you don\u2019t need to ask about it. But I like work environments where people get along and occasionally meet outside of work, so if you\u2019re the same as me and want to find out about this, then it\u2019s a great, creative question to ask.</p>\n<h2>26. What are your company values, and how do they impact the work here?</h2>\n<p>Many candidates will ask employers about the role and the company in general. For example, they\u2019ll ask, \u201cWhat will the typical day here look like?\u201d That\u2019s not a particularly creative or unique question to ask the interviewer, though. They\u2019ve heard it over and over. And they\u2019ve also heard generic questions about the <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-is-company-culture-how-to-improve-yours/\">company culture</a>. So that\u2019s why you\u2019ll benefit from this unique question, which is a bit more creative and combines the two topics. With this question, you\u2019re asking about their values and exactly how they impact the daily work environment. This will make the interviewer think a bit and impress them, plus it\u2019ll provide you valuable info in your job search as you try to find a role and company that you\u2019ll enjoy. One word of caution here, though: Don\u2019t ask the employer any questions that can be answered on their company website. So, for example, if the employer\u2019s top values are listed on their website \u201cAbout\u201d page, you could rephrase the question and say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI saw on your website that some of your core values include integrity, openness, and community involvement. Can you describe how that translates into the everyday work here, and my role?\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<p>That\u2019s an example of a fantastic, creative question to ask an interviewer that shows a high level of thought, effort, and research.</p>\n<h2><b>27. What Does a Typical Day or Week Look Like in This Role?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With this question, you\u2019re asking the interviewer to explain the primary duties and tasks you\u2019ll encounter if they hire you for the role. Their answer should go beyond the responsibilities listed in the job description. They\u2019ll likely describe any major projects they\u2019ll want you to take over in the early months of the position and the people you\u2019ll work with. An in-depth response will help to clarify any duties you\u2019re unsure of, and you can follow up with additional questions as you learn more about the role.</span></p>\n<h2><b>28. What Types of Skills Is the Team Missing that You Are Looking for in a New Hire?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you ask this question, you\u2019ll learn what the interviewer is looking for </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in a new hire</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some industries</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> try to promote from within, so if they\u2019re opening the role to external candidates, it\u2019s either an entry-level role or their current team members don\u2019t have the skills or experience necessary to handle the job. Hopefully, you have what they\u2019re looking for and can tell them so after listening to their response.</span></p>\n<h2><b>29. Would This Role Involve Traveling?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some jobs require infrequent or frequent travel. For instance, sales professionals regularly travel to meet with clients and attend industry events. If you enjoy traveling, the role may be a good fit for you. If you have responsibilities that limit your ability to travel, asking up front about the travel requirements can help you determine whether you\u2019ll be able to meet their expectations.</span></p>\n<h2><b>30. Is Overtime Expected?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some jobs require overtime. People may work longer hours during certain times of the month or according to the seasons. This question will tell you whether the role involves overtime and when you\u2019ll likely work longer hours. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If working overtime is a problem, you\u2019ll need to specify during the interview any limitations you have.</span></p>\n<h2><b>31. Do You Expect the Responsibilities of This Role to Change in the Near Future?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most jobs have essential responsibilities that remain static over time, but sometimes companies introduce significant changes that could impact the tasks you\u2019ll be responsible for. For example, if the company plans to expand the department, the role you\u2019re interviewing for may change drastically. You may need to take on additional projects or duties not included in the job description. When you ask this question, you\u2019ll learn of any known changes to the company or department that may crop up over the next six to twelve months.</span></p>\n<h2><b>32. How Long Does the Average Person Stay with the Company?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a fair question, but it may offend the interviewer, especially if they\u2019ve had recent issues with employee retention. If they indicate that several people recently left, you may ask why. Sometimes employees leave for better opportunities, but other times, the workplace is toxic. However, keep in mind that some industries are more cyclical than others. For instance, <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/15-most-common-retail-interview-questions-and-answers/\">retail</a> stores usually hire extra employees during the holiday season.</span></p>\n<h2><b>33. How Do You Reward Employees for Good Work?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you shouldn\u2019t expect a big reward for performing the primary duties of your job, occasionally, you may need to go the extra mile. Perhaps your manager will ask you to take on a unique project or require you to work overtime during a busy period. Usually, companies try to compensate their employees when they go <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/went-above-and-beyond/\">above and beyond</a>. When you ask this question, you\u2019ll learn whether the employer will value your extra efforts.</span></p>\n<h2><b>34. How Does Senior Management Interact with the Person in This Position?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If moving up the career ladder is vital to you, you\u2019ll want to get to know senior leaders in the organization. Asking this question will tell you whether your role will involve any interactions with senior management, like meetings or projects you might work on. Remember that your position may evolve as your manager learns your capabilities. If the role doesn\u2019t involve any initial interactions with senior management, your manager may give you future projects that allow you to display your strengths to the leadership team.</span></p>\n<h2><b>35. Are There Any Other Tasks You Require This Position to Do That Are Not Mentioned in the Job Description?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In some cases, human resources is responsible for preparing job descriptions for open roles in the company. That department may be unfamiliar with the full responsibilities of the position, so the job description may lack a few critical tasks you\u2019ll handle if the company hires you. Asking this question allows the hiring manager to describe any duties they\u2019ll expect you to oversee that the job description doesn\u2019t include.</span></p>\n<h2><b>36. What Do You Like Best About Your Job?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asking this question will allow you to learn more about the positive aspects of working for the company. Your interviewer will likely share what they enjoy about the organization and what excites them about their role. A genuine response indicates the interviewer truly loves where they work, which is an excellent sign that the company is attractive to work for.</span></p>\n<h2><b>37. What Is the Company\u2019s Overall Leadership Style?</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you ask this question, you\u2019ll learn the organization\u2019s approach to management. Some companies follow a typical leadership structure, where managers expect employees to handle tasks without asking questions. Other companies take a more flexible approach to leadership, where employees have more authority in their daily responsibilities.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2>38. What are the next steps in the interview process and when can I expect to hear back?</h2>\n<p>While not as creative as some of the questions above\u2026 this is a strong question to ask an interviewer because it shows that you\u2019re organized and interested in the role. This question will also give you insight into what to expect after the interview ends, so you\u2019ll be less anxious while waiting for feedback. You\u2019ll know how long to wait after the interview, and you\u2019ll be ready to <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/follow-up-after-interview-no-response/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">follow up by email</a> if you haven\u2019t heard back in the timeframe provided. For these reasons, I recommend asking this question at the end of all your job interviews.</p>\n<h2>Bonus idea: Ask questions about topics you discussed in the interview</h2>\n<p>Some of the most interesting and unique questions to ask in an interview will be related to topics discussed earlier. These aren\u2019t questions you can plan out in advance; instead, they\u2019re questions that come to mind as the conversation with the company happens.</p>\n<p>For example, you could say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\u201cI have a question to ask. Earlier, you mentioned that I would rotate between a couple of different teams and tasks depending on the week. Is that something that most employees in this department are doing? Or is that something that would be unique to my role?\u201d</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Conclusion: What to Do Next</h2>\n<p>Asking questions is a crucial part of impressing an employer in the interview. <strong>Ask creative, interesting questions and you\u2019ll stick in an interviewer\u2019s mind and boost your odds of getting the job. </strong>If you read everything above, you now know have a long list of unique questions to ask in your interviews. As you prepare for your interviews, <strong>I recommend picking three or four of the above questions and then asking each company the same questions.&nbsp; </strong>This will help you remember your questions and also compare answers between employers, all while making a great impression so you hear back from more employers.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-5db80e85\">\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-base-2-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-base-2-background-color has-background\">\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-0ec43197\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-2e6a8c4d\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-7b1c6b54\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-7b1c6b54\">\n<figure class=\"gb-block-image gb-block-image-8796466a\"><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/author/biron/\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='150'%20height='150'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Biron Clark\" class=\"avatar avatar-150 wp-user-avatar wp-user-avatar-150 alignnone photo gb-image-8796466a perfmatters-lazy\" data-src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Biron-Clark-uai-158x158.png\" data-srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Biron-Clark-uai-336x336.png 2x\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Biron-Clark-uai-158x158.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Biron-Clark-uai-336x336.png 2x\" alt=\"Biron Clark\" class=\"avatar avatar-150 wp-user-avatar wp-user-avatar-150 alignnone photo gb-image-8796466a\" /></noscript></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-6d502a65\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-6d502a65\">\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-aefdd19e gb-headline-text\"><strong>About the Author</strong></p>\n\n\n<div style=\"font-size:16px;\" class=\"wp-block-post-author-biography\">Biron Clark is a former executive recruiter who has worked individually with hundreds of job seekers, reviewed thousands of resumes and LinkedIn profiles, and recruited for top venture-backed startups and Fortune 500 companies.

Consider where you want to see yourself in five years and what lifestyle suits you. This will help you clarify how your next role fits into this vision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reflect on what brings you joy and energy in your current or most recent job. Identifying these elements can highlight your strengths and pinpoint areas you\u2019re passionate about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Research the common job titles in the current job market, and ask yourself these questions to clarify your interest: What products or services do you enjoy working with? Do you prefer working on a B2B or B2C marketing strategy? What is your target industry?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-base-3-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-6fd0f21400364dda7d3ce84a0d6f65e4\">.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-82d20821c544033b26ad0341aa3fdf71\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong>Can you provide tips on how to set realistic career goals within the marketing industry, especially in a highly competitive job market?</strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDepending on your situation, you may need to adjust your goal to be able to see faster and better results. For example, if most of your marketing experiences are in small companies, and you want to advance your career in an enterprise setting, it might take various routes to get into your dream company. You may need to start with a mid-size company and gain more experience in a specific marketing function or work on side projects to gain knowledge in certain industries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few common reasons marketing professionals feel lost in the job search, including not sure what they want in their next career, what they are good at, or how to market their talents to potential employers.

Many of my clients also have concerns about changing their job titles, and I usually tell them that as long as the title focuses on things they\u2019ve done, then it\u2019s okay to tweak it to match the job market\u2019s needs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Unclear Career Goal</strong>\u2014Don\u2019t state that you are open to any marketing position or are interested in both B2B and B2C marketing. It is important that you highlight your niche and point out your specialty on your resume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Typos</strong>\u2014In marketing, no company will risk hiring someone who is not detail-oriented when writing their resume. When I was a corporate recruiter, I witnessed a great candidate being rejected because the hiring manager noticed a small timeline typo on his resume. You don\u2019t want that to happen to you, so be sure to double and triple-check your resume before finalizing it.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-2d8f82e2\">\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-left has-large-font-size\"><strong><strong><strong>Essential Steps for a Marketing Job Interview</strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-6378beaf\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-5b8df85c\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-5b8df85c\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-842dc896\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-aa39f8d0\">\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-02fe4361312a2a97191616dbce0657dc\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Once the resume has landed them an interview, what are the most important aspects of preparation for a marketing job interview?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cRead the job description to understand what the role entails, and research the interviewer by checking their LinkedIn profiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Preparing real work examples for potential interview questions, both behavioral and technical.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prepare 2-3 insightful questions to ask. Here are some great questions you can ask during your interview: What are the current challenges in the team or the company?&nbsp;What main project will this role be responsible for? How do you measure the success of this role?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-ba4c0da07b25f78831685b2f4e11ac97\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>If there was one interview question you wish marketers were more prepared for, which question would that be and why?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cHow did you resolve conflict when working with cross-functional teams?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a tricky question, and most job seekers have difficulty answering it. There is no doubt that conflict will happen in any workplace, so the interviewer wants to know how well you can handle the stress at work while remaining professional. The key is to provide a real story starting from a negative situation but ending in a positive result. Even though you are lucky enough never to have to deal with conflict in your work history, try your best to share any relevant examples from your school project, volunteer work, or any side project.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-3ff0e2a7a78ab9bc3155c3649f910a79\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>And if there was one skill you believe every marketer should demonstrate during an interview, what would it be and how can they showcase it effectively?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<strong>Cross-functional Communication.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you should provide a real work example to demonstrate this specific skill. The example should showcase your different communication strategies while working with different departments. For example, product marketing professionals usually need to work closely with engineering teams, so knowing how to translate non-technical information to technical professionals is critical. Vice versa, translating technical information to help marketing teams work more efficiently will help your potential employers know that you are a great communicator for the job.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-5a14a43e0c74c8a8e0a24c1161727e83\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Can you share some final advice for handling stress and nervousness during marketing job interviews?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<strong>Preparation</strong>\u2014Be sure to do your research before the interview. Learn about the company, read the job description, and check any public information. Prepare examples from your past experiences that demonstrate your skills and achievements, and be ready to answer any questions regarding information on your resume.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Positive Self-Talk</strong>\u2014Practice positive affirmations and remind yourself that you are well-prepared and capable of handling the interview successfully. Visualize yourself confidently answering questions and engaging with the interviewer is another way to help calm the nervousness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Just Be You</strong>\u2014It\u2019s natural to feel nervous before and during an interview, and most interviewers understand this. Instead of fixating on potential outcomes or worrying about making mistakes, concentrate on actively listening to the interviewer, engaging in the conversation, and asking great questions to showcase your passion for the job.\u201d</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-a4ef04f8\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-ba57e0f0\">\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-2fa6622f gb-headline-text\"><strong>Want more expert insights?

And what this means is, look at the flip side of your weakness, which can usually be turned into a strength. For example, if you\u2019re not seen as the most decisive person, then you can lean into that and be the person who instead taps into the wisdom of the room and builds consensus.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"mv-ad-box\" data-slotid=\"content_3_btf\" style=\"height: 250px; width: max(300px, 100%); overflow: clip !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-frame-250\" data-slotid=\"content_3_btf\" style=\"overflow: visible !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-slide-250\" data-slotid=\"content_3_btf\" style=\"overflow: visible !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-sticky-250\" data-slotid=\"content_3_btf\"><div id=\"content_3_btf_wrapper\" class=\"adunitwrapper content_btf_wrapper\" data-wrapper=\"content_3_btf\" data-nosnippet=\"\">\n          <div id=\"content_3_btf\" class=\"content_btf adunit\">\n            \n          </div>\n        </div><mv-ad-reporter data-slot-id=\"content_3_btf\" data-offering=\"1\" data-offering-name=\"mediavine\" data-offering-domain=\"mediavine.com\"></mv-ad-reporter></div></div></div>\n  \n        \n    \n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Partner with Someone Who has the Complementary Skill to Your Weakness: </strong>So for example, if you\u2019re indecisive, you could team up with somebody who is very good at making decisions. So you form a leadership team and can solve problems together more effectively.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Go on a Campaign: </strong>If it\u2019s a perception issue and your \u201cweakness\u201d is just something people haven\u2019t seen you do yet, then you can go on a campaign. This is what my friend and former colleague Carla Harris did. People weren\u2019t perceiving her as tough, even though she was plenty tough. So she went on a campaign to use the word \u201ctough\u201d as many times as she possibly could. And in a few months, she heard her team coming down the hall saying, \u201cI hope you did all your homework because Carla Harris is so tough.\u201d And she knew she had really nailed it.\u201d</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-8872a189cf2c33e1ffb446859bff590e\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong>How important is self-awareness in leadership development, and what are the best practices for enhancing it?</strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cSelf-awareness is at the heart of being a great leader. Leadership is about progressing toward a common purpose by bringing people along. So if you\u2019re not aware of how you are landing with others and how others are perceiving you, then that can be a real problem for you as a leader.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are three things you can do to develop your self-awareness:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Pause and Notice Your Own Behavior in the Moment:</strong> And that takes being more present in the moment. Then you can be intentional about observing yourself and then choosing how you want to conduct yourself, how you want to speak, and how you want to come across.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Be Open to (and Invite) Feedback:</strong> Feedback can be so scary because we don\u2019t like to hear that we aren\u2019t doing things exactly perfectly. But as one of my colleagues says, \u201cFeedback is love.\u201d Platonically, of course. Feedback is love. Framing it this way makes it a whole lot easier to be open to that feedback, listen to it, and take the pieces that are really going to help you become a better leader.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Ask Yourself \u201cWhat\u201d Questions, not \u201cWhy\u201d Questions:</strong> For example, instead of asking, \u201cWhy did I say it that way?\u201d Ask yourself, \u201cWhat was it that caused me to say that? What was the situation? What was I doing?\u201d This is something I learned from Tasha Eurick her HBR article about what self-awareness really is and how to cultivate it. And it works because \u201cwhat\u201d questions lead you to concrete action steps you can take. Instead of worrying or assuming the worst about \u201cwhy\u201d something happened, you can take action to address what went wrong and what you can do differently next time.\u201d</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-left has-large-font-size\"><strong><strong>Navigating Career Transitions and Opportunities</strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-604f40c76c908b5fc0aeaabcac26fdc2\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>What key factors should professionals consider when contemplating a significant career change or advancement opportunity?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"gb-block-image gb-block-image-f71cc466\" data-slot-rendered-content=\"true\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"300\" height=\"217\" class=\"gb-image gb-image-f71cc466\" src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/May-Busch-Photo-for-CareerSidekick-2-300x217.jpg\" alt=\"May is speaking on stage at a conference\" title=\"May Busch Photo for CareerSidekick\" srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/May-Busch-Photo-for-CareerSidekick-2-300x217.jpg 300w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/May-Busch-Photo-for-CareerSidekick-2-1024x741.jpg 1024w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/May-Busch-Photo-for-CareerSidekick-2-768x556.jpg 768w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/May-Busch-Photo-for-CareerSidekick-2-1536x1111.jpg 1536w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/May-Busch-Photo-for-CareerSidekick-2.jpg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\">\n<figcaption class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-ae34ca09 gb-headline-text\"><em>May Busch</em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n<div class=\"mv-ad-box\" data-slotid=\"content_4_btf\" style=\"height: 250px; width: max(300px, 100%); overflow: clip !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-frame-250\" data-slotid=\"content_4_btf\" style=\"overflow: visible !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-slide-250\" data-slotid=\"content_4_btf\" style=\"overflow: visible !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-sticky-250\" data-slotid=\"content_4_btf\"><div id=\"content_4_btf_wrapper\" class=\"adunitwrapper content_btf_wrapper\" data-wrapper=\"content_4_btf\" data-nosnippet=\"\">\n          <div id=\"content_4_btf\" class=\"content_btf adunit\">\n            \n          </div>\n        </div><mv-ad-reporter data-slot-id=\"content_4_btf\" data-offering=\"1\" data-offering-name=\"mediavine\" data-offering-domain=\"mediavine.com\"></mv-ad-reporter></div></div></div>\n  \n        \n    \n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<strong>Here are three actions to take when you\u2019re thinking about a career change or new opportunity:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Listen to Your Inner Voice:</strong> Take time to reconnect with yourself.

Ask them for their observations on when you\u2019ve been the most and least happy in your career, and what you were doing in each case. This gives you an outside perspective on your preferences you might not have noticed otherwise.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Conduct Experiments: </strong>An experiment is the smallest possible step you can take that gives you information without risking your career. It\u2019s like a \u201cbaby step.\u201d For example, you could set up a meeting with someone who is in the position you want.

And the more likely it is that your transition will be successful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Finally, to build your strategic network</strong>,<strong> be thoughtful about the kinds of people you will need in your career. </strong>Ideally, choose people you trust and respect who collectively bring a mix of talents, expertise, experiences, backgrounds, seniority, skill sets and connections. And when you meet with them, remember to end the conversation with, \u201cWho else should I talk to?\u201d or \u201cWho else would have interest in this?\u201d That way you can keep expanding your network with warm introductions.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-2d8f82e2\" data-slot-rendered-content=\"true\">\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-left has-large-font-size\"><strong><strong>Building and Leading High-Performing Teams</strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-6378beaf\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-5b8df85c\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-5b8df85c\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-842dc896\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-aa39f8d0\">\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-84743967ea7fdf1ba768029dd43ee11c\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>How can leaders effectively manage diverse teams to harness different strengths and perspectives?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201c<strong>Here are 3 ways to bring out the best in a diverse team:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Engage in \u201cReverse Mentoring\u201d: </strong>This is when you ask your team members for advice.

I learned HTML coding right after high school, and at the age of 18, I founded my first (but not last) company that focused on web and <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/graphic-designer-2/\">graphic design</a>. This was the beginning, but not the end. My first job in marketing was this. It was a self-made venture where I found solace in self-learning. After that, as they say, the rest is history. I\u2019ve been on film sets and video game design studios, worked with Fortune 1000s, and am notably proud of my work over the past seventeen years. This prepared me for my role as a <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/marketing-manager/\">Marketing Manager</a> because in my time, I had to learn how to not only manage a company but also, to manage people.

A common denominator amongst most of us building professions is our love of LEGOs as kids: seeing how they go together, challenging ourselves with new designs or projects, or perhaps chasing that desire to help others with our skills (i.e. LEGO minifigures with their houses, spaceships, cars, etc.) This grew into my love for designing efficient spaces and challenging conventional means of creating systems. I was initially interested in architecture\u2026 but decided toward the STEM fields upon my high school success with technical classes and becoming fixated on a newer field called architectural engineering (AE).\u201d</p>\n\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-contrast-3-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-contrast-3-background-color has-background is-style-dots\">\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-1bdaff30\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-374d81b1\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-374d81b1\">\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong>Can you walk us through your educational journey?

While now I realize the world\u2019s a lot bigger than the Midwestern United States, moving 4-hours across the river to another middle-of-nowhere town in Missouri was a huge step. Having crossed straight architecture off my list, I was limited to either Missouri S&amp;T, IIT, or Kansas schools for nearby programs offering AE degree work. Upon my research and partially growing up down the road in Rolla, I chose S&amp;T for the highly reputable programs offered, growing rankings, but strong emphasis on real-world engineering experience better preparing S&amp;T <em>Miners</em> compared to other programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The beauty of AE is it\u2019s strongly based on coursework in civil, electrical, or <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/mechanical-engineer/\">mechanical engineering</a>, with some programs emphasizing more on others. S&amp;T offered a fast-track program to obtain your typical AE degree in 4 years plus a CE degree in another semester given the strong structural and materials classes that both AE and CE\u2019s take. Many alumni I spoke to encouraged me to go ahead with the dual degrees, becoming more valuable and knowledgeable on other civil subjects compared to my peers.\u201d</p>\n\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-contrast-3-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-contrast-3-background-color has-background is-style-dots\">\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-09ac8667\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-8d431462\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-8d431462\">\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong>What initial hurdles did you encounter as you entered the architectural engineering profession?</strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-191c4702\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-191c4702\">\n\n<p>\u201cImposter syndrome, hands down.

Whilst my undergraduate education didn\u2019t quite prepare me for conducting site visits, audits, or submittals, it did set me on the right path towards taking the initiative of my future career and consistently learning new things, especially with the broad-based concepts covered in building systems engineering.\u201d</p>\n\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-contrast-3-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-contrast-3-background-color has-background is-style-dots\">\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-4618571f\">\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-left has-large-font-size\">What\u2019s Life as an Architectural Engineer</h2>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-contrast-3-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-contrast-3-background-color has-background is-style-dots\">\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-3ded8c48\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-43697ca6\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-43697ca6\">\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong>Could you describe a typical day in your life as an architectural engineer?</strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-b2081b87\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-b2081b87\">\n\n<p>\u201cMost AE\u2019s fall into two camps: construction or consultant. If you\u2019re like me, you work in the office most of the time drafting designs with computer-aided design (CAD) software like Revit, calculating proper mechanical loads for equipment to adequately heat or cool a space, laying out and circuiting lighting, or piping plumbing throughout a building. For existing buildings that are renovated, we have to conduct site visits to see for ourselves the existing ductwork, panel feeds and service, and other items before moving forward with our designs. After we heavily coordinate with structural engineers, architects, civil site engineers, interior designers, and others, we submit our drawings to the authority-having jurisdiction (AHJ) who sends back comments to fully comply with codes and ordinances, and then submit them to the construction team. These AE\u2019s then take our plans to do field and construction engineering.\u201d</p>\n\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-contrast-3-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-contrast-3-background-color has-background is-style-dots\">\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-7d381fbb\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-2965773b\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-2965773b\">\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong>What are the most challenging and rewarding aspects of working in architectural engineering that you\u2019ve encountered?</strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-18b7a581\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-18b7a581\">\n\n<p>\u201cWorking primarily on Missouri and Illinois jobs, one of the most challenging aspects is properly referencing the correct codes and ordinances. Compared to other states that adopt statewide building codes, MO and IL are enforced at the county-level with all counties having various versions of the International Building Code (IBC), National Electric Code (NEC), and more. Another one that all design engineers will relate to is how architects or interior designers underestimate the space requirements or leave inadequate room for design revisions for building engineers (i.e. leaving 6 inches of ceiling space in apartment units when 12 inches in diameter spiral ductwork is needed.) This also humorously bleeds into the structural side with structural engineers frequently \u201cmessing up\u201d architects\u2019 initial plans with spaces to adequately support roof or wall structures. This is all remediated with strong communication and collaboration amongst project disciplines throughout the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most rewarding aspects is realizing the intimate difference you make in future occupants\u2019 lives. I recently heard this explanation of a chef, who takes strong pride in making great food for people as it nourishes people\u2019s bodies and can be perceived as an artwork or a way to communicate with others. I find this similar to my profession, where we design and create places where people will spend 90% of their day in; we need to have good heating and cooling, great electrical and lighting, or sustainable plumbing solutions. Especially considering our primary markets include multifamily and hospitality projects, creating spaces for future occupants is particularly rewarding knowing what we design matters.\u201d</p>\n\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-contrast-3-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-contrast-3-background-color has-background is-style-dots\">\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-fab0a310\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-1352a445\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-1352a445\">\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong>How do you stay current with industry trends and technologies in architectural engineering?</strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-4cce560b\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-4cce560b\">\n\n<p>\u201cProfessional organizations that offer up-to-date technical training, local webinars or credentialing, and a sense of community for like-minded professionals are invaluable to all engineers.

With an annual small pool of architectural engineering undergraduates and the highly specialized nature of our profession, others naturally assume we\u2019re architects versus engineers. It should be noted AE grew out of the need for a new discipline that knew the design and drafting skills needed for elegant architecture, but also the logic and strong engineering skills needed to support these designs in reality.

A well-rounded degree in a profession such as architectural engineering will never limit you, taking you further to jobs or careers that are yet to become mainstream. No matter what area you specialize in, there are plenty of AE\u2019s at your side in communities such as Architectural Engineering Institute (AEI) to help you advance in your career.\u201d</p>\n\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-contrast-3-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-contrast-3-background-color has-background is-style-dots\">\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-3a349f26\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-460dc63a\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-460dc63a\">\n\n<figure class=\"gb-block-image gb-block-image-eab1bcb1\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"512\" height=\"513\" class=\"gb-image gb-image-eab1bcb1 perfmatters-lazy\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='512'%20height='513'%20viewBox='0%200%20512%20513'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"\" title=\"Brenan-Pool-2\" data-src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Brenan-Pool-2-e1716773263794.png\" data-srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Brenan-Pool-2-e1716773263794.png 512w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Brenan-Pool-2-e1716773263794-300x300.png 300w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Brenan-Pool-2-e1716773263794-290x290.png 290w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"512\" height=\"513\" class=\"gb-image gb-image-eab1bcb1\" src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Brenan-Pool-2-e1716773263794.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Brenan-Pool-2\" srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Brenan-Pool-2-e1716773263794.png 512w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Brenan-Pool-2-e1716773263794-300x300.png 300w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Brenan-Pool-2-e1716773263794-290x290.png 290w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" /></noscript></figure>\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-6281e8b5\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-6281e8b5\">\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-left has-large-font-size\">Reader Q &amp; A with Brenan Pool</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-990197f0\">\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-base-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-base-background-color has-background\">\n\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-038316e9\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-81bec291\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-81bec291\">\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-e01f0d06\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-5adc614d\">\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-99388d7c1ad2da80efbb2c2c327e1d3c\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong>Can you share an experience where you had to overcome significant obstacles in a project?</strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n</div>\n</div></blockquote>\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-8ec7d5eb\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-8ec7d5eb\">\n\n<p>\u201cOne project that comes to mind is when we recently redesigned the whole mechanical design we initially proposed.

Liz Bentley, a master of leadership development and executive coaching, confronts these pressing issues head-on. In this riveting Q&amp;A, she unpacks how leaders often feel adrift, struggling to connect with their teams and manage effectively from afar. With her expert guidance, Liz <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/selling-crafts/\">crafts</a> a lifeline of strategies and insights, enabling leaders to transform these challenges into opportunities for growth and innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-5acc98e8\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-1787aa48\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-1787aa48\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-7472014b\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-3676f72c\">\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-dbbc07d5c1cf85579e61f2bd0cbcc680\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>What are the most common challenges leaders face in today\u2019s fast-paced work environment, and how can executive coaching address them?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis year ahead is going to be hard. But, the good thing is\u2014we know how to do hard things! A challenging environment pushes us to either grow or decline. So, if we see this as an opportunity to step into our power, we will be better in the end. Executive Coaching allows me to be a dedicated support system to help my client navigate the challenges; I\u2019m going to offer perspective (uncovering blind spots standing in your way) and accountability.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-3ab4aed38a0150b93224ccb90ba859ea\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong>Can you share a success story where attending a leadership seminar significantly impacted an individual\u2019s career or leadership style?</strong></h2>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe best thing that comes out of my leadership seminars are the blind spots that we uncover, the open communication, and the confidence. Seeing leaders try something new and level themselves up and their business is what makes this all worth it. I have clients that have doubled their business revenue, cultivated teams with a culture of feedback, and taken the next steps in their careers all from a leadership seminar.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-3e59234ec7a55a408ca4a5b37928d491\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong>How has the transition from traditional to remote or hybrid leadership models impacted the way leaders should approach team management and motivation?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI was recently on CBS News New York with Mary Calvin talking about this. A new study by Live Data Technologies showed that remote workers are promoted 31% less than those in office. There\u2019s been a widespread acceptance of <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-is-a-remote-job-remote-work-101/\">remote work</a> but there is a prevailing trend where those physically present in the office tend to receive greater recognition. This can be extremely difficult for a leader to navigate, especially with a hybrid schedule or if the team has flexibility to decide on their own. It\u2019s important to have active involvement and explore various avenues to stay connected with every single member of your team.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-26069dff2d89da22a7d7d95df70ea971\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong>In your experience, what are the key traits that distinguish a good leader from a great one in the context of organizational growth and culture development?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cA great leader has a high level of emotional intelligence with the ability to strategically give feedback and receive it without becoming defensive. Emotional intelligence allows us to communicate clearly and be able to listen and understand ourselves and others. A great leader also values people\u2014people matter and it\u2019s important to understand different personalities. At the core of our lives are relationships, and understanding people better, including ourselves, can have a dramatic impact on productivity.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-276fa1dc\">\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-left has-large-font-size\"><strong><strong>Building High-Performance Teams</strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-4cf5208226dbcfb1c9469a6a7c8ec1a9\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>How can organizations effectively identify and nurture high-potential employees to take on leadership roles?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"gb-block-image gb-block-image-f71cc466\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"919\" height=\"612\" class=\"gb-image gb-image-f71cc466\" src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Liz-Bentley-2-1.png\" alt=\"Picture of Liz Bentley\" title=\"Liz-Bentley-2-1\" srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Liz-Bentley-2-1.png 919w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Liz-Bentley-2-1-300x200.png 300w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Liz-Bentley-2-1-768x511.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 919px) 100vw, 919px\">\n<figcaption class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-ae34ca09 gb-headline-text\"><em>Liz Bentley </em></figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMost organizations need support training, nurturing, and promoting the next guard. We offer leadership training seminars and coaching specifically for this purpose. These high-potential employees now need to level up even further by leveraging their signature presence, enhancing their emotional intelligence and expanding their mindsets with a more strategic vision for the future. Organizations need to effectively inspire them to step out of their comfort zones. There is a new set of leadership and management skills they\u2019ll have to learn such as navigating difficult conversations, delegation, and giving and receiving feedback. We offer leadership seminar series and individualized coaching to help organizations with this.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-b0a0febeae5cb1a05952c862ef3aeebb\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>In what ways can leaders leverage diversity and inclusion to enhance team performance and innovation?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThis all goes back to understanding people and having a high level of emotional intelligence. People bring different perspectives to our lives. Here, we explore the Imprinting Years. These are the first 10 years of life where those experiences make up our story from our origins, geography, beliefs, family, appearance, intelligence, talents, personality, and strengths and weaknesses. Understanding the people on your team will only enhance performance and innovation. Empathy connects us. Judgment and sympathy divide us.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-309e77c8dcb5b3b32b87d9a89422feff\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>What role does feedback play in sustaining high performance, and how can leaders implement it effectively?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cFeedback is vital in sustaining high performance. Getting feedback gives us new perspectives on <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/problem-solving-examples/\">problem solving</a>, collaboration, and process. Being open to feedback instead of being defensive allows us to get more and teams to work better together. Giving feedback helps us share opinions and strategies that others may not have realized. Knowing how to give and receive feedback effectively helps connectivity and innovation. Giving and getting feedback can be scary\u2014we have services such as training, seminars, and speeches dedicated fully to feedback because people are so scared of it! Once you can expand beyond what\u2019s holding you back, you will see more successful outcomes both in your team and yourself as a leader.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-8e07e9e70d3753e69e03643281e4080a\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>How does team coaching differ from individual coaching, and what are its unique benefits in building cohesive teams?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For teams to strive for high performance, they need to function with fluidity, working off of each other\u2019s strengths and mitigating their weaknesses. You\u2019re only as strong as your weakest link. The ability to be a good team player is not always innate. In Team Coaching, people will learn how to function in their role to become a valuable asset to the group. Here you create shared goals and visions, give support where needed, give feedback effectively, share opinions, and take risks. Individual coaching offers a more customized program for that particular person based off their own goals for growth. Both are hugely important to building cohesive teams. We often will do team coaching sessions supplemented with 1v1 coaching sessions in between to really dive deep and create change.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-cf0f2e9ec710ccfd917f81e53fd9070b\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>What role do retreats play in fostering innovation and strategic thinking among leadership teams?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTeam Retreats set the stage for growth by providing an opportunity to spend time together outside of the usual work environment to align your vision, create strategies, and get to know each other better! Retreats should always be a key part of strategic planning for the future of your business. Here, we like to cover topics such as \u201cCreating an Environment of Excellence\u201d, \u201cBe a High Functioning Team\u2019, and \u201cStrategic Planning\u201d. Teams typically feel a sense of letting their guard down a bit on retreats that allows for creative brainstorming, innovative thinking, building goals, and boosting morale.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-2d8f82e2\">\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-left has-large-font-size\"><strong><strong>The Importance of Coaching for Real-estate and Sales Professionals</strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-2eb4a595\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-ce914d3d\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-ce914d3d\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-e8a92385\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-5cca5374\">\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-beeb49e04f504148da1bb6125be0fc67\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Given the unique challenges of the real estate market, what are some core areas of focus in your real estate coaching programs?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI recently did a speech for Atlanta Fines Home &amp; Mountains real estate teams where I shared how in order to level up in 2024, we need to upgrade our operating systems!

In 1v1 coaching with my <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/real-estate-agent/\">real estate agent</a> clients, we discuss how to prioritize their time, focusing their time on the right work and knowing when to move on from something. One of the great equalizers in life is time. We all are equal when it comes to time. No one gets more than another person. Time is the divider between the good and the great.

A pillar of my coaching method is our Sports Performance Model. We train leaders in the workplace, the same way coaches train athletes to champions. I always have my eye on the end game for my clients and push them to be better versions of themselves.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-3cc46067\">\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>In both sports and business, mental toughness plays a crucial role. Can you discuss how you help executives cultivate this trait?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe can\u2019t control the environment, we can\u2019t change what\u2019s coming at us. We can decide what we are going to do with it. Our life gets divided by the micro-decisions we make every single day. Those decisions dictate which box we fall into\u2014do we do what is hard or what is easy? When you keep choosing hard things, you get better at them, and then they don\u2019t seem hard anymore. You grow. You get more confident. You build mental toughness. During 1v1 coaching with my clients, we work on making the right decisions each week that will be hard, but we will grow from and thus build confidence.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>What are some effective metrics or indicators you recommend leaders use to assess their personal growth and leadership effectiveness?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI think 360 feedback reviews are great for uncovering areas of growth that you may be unaware of. It can unearth blind spots and help you see how others perceive you.&nbsp; This can then lead you to make changes in your business that will have big and positive impacts. We also like the DISC personality assessment because it not only gives you a deeper understanding of your strengths and weaknesses but it also give you insights into other personality styles and how to work best with them.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n</div>\n</div>\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-5db80e85\">\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-base-2-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-base-2-background-color has-background\">\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-0ec43197\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-2e6a8c4d\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-7b1c6b54\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-7b1c6b54\">\n<figure class=\"gb-block-image gb-block-image-8796466a\"><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/author/liz-bently/\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='150'%20height='150'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Liz Bentley\" class=\"avatar avatar-150 wp-user-avatar wp-user-avatar-150 alignnone photo gb-image-8796466a perfmatters-lazy\" data-src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Liz-Bentley-290x290.png\" data-srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Liz-Bentley.png 2x\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Liz-Bentley-290x290.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Liz-Bentley.png 2x\" alt=\"Liz Bentley\" class=\"avatar avatar-150 wp-user-avatar wp-user-avatar-150 alignnone photo gb-image-8796466a\" /></noscript></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-6d502a65\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-6d502a65\">\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-aefdd19e gb-headline-text\"><strong>About the Author</strong></p>\n\n\n<div style=\"font-size:16px;\" class=\"wp-block-post-author-biography\">Liz Bentley is the esteemed founder and CEO of Liz Bentley Associates, renowned for empowering executives and transforming organizations through her expertise in leadership development, executive coaching, and motivational speaking.

This Q&amp;A session is designed to empower both emerging and experienced pharmacists with essential tools for showcasing their passion for pharmacy, clinical expertise, and problem-solving skills.

A few important things that candidates should keep in mind in preparing for an interview include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Know your non-negotiables, your unique strengths and your values going in. What is it that you hope to gain within this new opportunity? How can you benefit the organization? What is important to you in your professional life? Having clarity around these answers can help you make the best decision in taking the next step in your career trajectory.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Be authentically <em><strong>you</strong></em>.

Recognizing that social connectedness is vitally important to both physical and mental health, pharmacists and future pharmacists can practice and spend focused time developing communication skills that benefit both patients and interprofessional teams. By practicing communication skills and specifically motivational interviewing strategies, pharmacists can achieve better outcomes for those they serve and also take care of themselves in the process.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-013284142d582862f15ef924c25b7456\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Even early in their careers, pharmacists may find themselves in leadership roles.

Adapt to local norms and practices accordingly.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Communication Style: </strong>Pay attention to directness, hierarchy, and formality in communication. Align your style with local norms.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hierarchy and Decision-Making: </strong>Learn about organizational structures and decision-making processes, whether centralized or decentralized.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Work-Life Balance: </strong>Understand expectations around work hours and balance. Different cultures prioritize differently.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Relationship Building</strong>: Invest time in building relationships with colleagues and stakeholders, crucial in many work cultures.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Attitude towards Authority: </strong>Understand attitudes towards authority figures and how they\u2019re respected or challenged.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Dress Code and Appearance:</strong> Familiarize yourself with workplace attire expectations, which can vary significantly across cultures.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cultural Sensitivity:</strong> Be mindful of cultural norms, values, and taboos to build rapport and avoid misunderstandings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Feedback and Criticism: </strong>Learn how feedback is given and received, whether direct or implicit.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Training and Development:</strong> Take advantage of orientation programs to better understand local work culture and practices.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Focusing on these areas enables professionals to adapt effectively to their new work environment.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-25224c29d22c4ababf01d0ec672097aa\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong>As foreigners start getting familiar with the work culture, how can they effectively tackle language barriers in their workplaces?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNowadays we have tools like Google Translator and ChatGPT to help us with words and concepts we don\u2019t understand. Have them readily accessible on your phone. In meeting contexts, you can quickly check words to clarify.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to written communication, Grammarly is another helpful tool to catch mistakes. Just be aware that those tools are not perfect and many times it misunderstands the context and suggests something wrong.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recommend having a Business English Tutor. Depending on the importance of the communication, have your Business English Tutor review communication documents for you. When I was at the University, my tutor would revise my papers with me, and this was very helpful in my development.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond that, be in peace with your vulnerability as immigrants and ask clarifying questions whenever necessary to ensure complete understanding about tasks and assignments. We are what we are: foreigners adapting at a new country, we need some grace. Find supportive colleagues and avoid those with a competitive, critical,&nbsp; and judging spirit who may have a negative attitude towards foreigners for this help.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-9f9ad99d6defcd36bb3bf6ee79fbf353\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong>Once language issues are being managed, what\u2019s the best way for immigrants to adapt to different communication styles and professional etiquette in their new environment?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cObservation remains key. Keep it human. Most humans speak the \u201chuman language.\u201d Be authentic while also considerate and respectful of cultural differences. Flexibility is key in adapting. Allow yourself to adopt some new ways of communicating and being while also maintaining some key values and allowing your unique identity to show.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a balance that you will figure out with time. You will need to experiment and see which boundaries feel comfortable and are effective at the same time. You are unique; your circumstances are unique, and there is no one recipe fits all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just avoid the trap of assimilation: abandoning your identity completely for the sake of fitting in. That leads to identity crisis, depression, and unhappiness. Find the right balance between transforming and remaining who you are at the core.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-d34bb987ef241c3e9b2ff9df4ae7e57c\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong>What strategies can foreign professionals use to fully integrate and feel included in their workplace community?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIntegration and inclusion can be fostered through:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Authenticity and Openness:</strong> Be comfortable with your identity and open to interactions. Smile, be friendly, and show willingness to engage with colleagues.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Taking Initiative to Connect: </strong>Take the first step in building relationships. Reach out, participate in team activities, and demonstrate willingness to contribute positively to the workplace community.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cultural Understanding: </strong>Be understanding of cultural differences and demonstrate patience and empathy towards colleagues. Address misunderstandings with humility and a willingness to learn.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Seeking Supportive Networks: </strong>Identify supportive colleagues and networks within the workplace. Avoid individuals with negative attitudes towards foreigners, prioritizing relationships with those who embrace diversity.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>By following these strategies, foreign professionals can integrate successfully into their workplace communities.\u201d</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-276fa1dc\">\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-left has-large-font-size\"><strong><strong>Tailoring Resumes and Personal Branding for the Local Job Market</strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-5acc98e8\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-1787aa48\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-1787aa48\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-7472014b\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-3676f72c\">\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-1c4b46e3ca62bc00de5dfdacf4f53f66\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>How can immigrants translate their international experience effectively for local employers when starting their job search?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>\u201cBe aware of culture norms for resumes (picture or not, size of paper, content expected).

Have an excellent, well written LinkedIn profile that is SEO optimized to attract the right opportunities and post regularly showcasing your knowledge, character, and successes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use the search to find alumni and other immigrants from your country. The common immigrant and alma mater background can be an attractor to build a relationship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Identify target companies and network specifically with people from those companies. Make yourself known. You have potential, but you need to make your existence and presence known to be considered. You need to be under their radar on LinkedIn, by making yourself noted in online groups, events, and networking meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connect with fellows by industry, trade, geographic location, or religious affiliation. Find a point of commonality to connect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Attend community events, political events, school functions, go to shows, join a religious community of faith, and volunteer. Volunteering is not only great to build your network, but to gain professional experience abroad (if you volunteer in your area), and have reference letters from professionals in the new country. Make an effort to make friends and integrate. When people know you are looking for a job, which at some point you will reveal in the conversation, they may even volunteer to help you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One common mistake immigrants should avoid is being cozy in their national community instead of integrating with natives. Yes, you will need the support of your immigrant community, but don\u2019t let that be the whole picture. The key to total integration and adaptation is to mingle with the culture and people as much as possible.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>What are some key strategies for immigrants to stand out in job interviews within culturally different settings?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAuthenticity, courage, a well-practiced and rehearsed message that speaks to the company\u2019s needs, being comfortable in your own skin, and being ready to stand tall as an immigrant, even if you mispronounce some words.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Structuring answers and interview practice is even more paramount to immigrants. Immigrants should expect to practice three times as much to really flow and be comfortable communicating.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:30px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Could you provide advice for immigrants on understanding and navigating unique recruitment processes in a new country?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI work mostly with the American and Brazilian markets.

This does not include non-licensed accountants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, it is important to note that there are several different types of accounting roles, levels, and responsibilities. The two common differentiators today are accountants who work in \u201cpublic practice\u201d and those who work in \u201cindustry\u201d.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Roles in public accounting typically include auditing, tax, financial advisory, and other financial services provided to clients of the firm. The Big 4 accounting firms are most well known (PwC, EY, Deloitte, KPMG).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas, industry accounting centers around the internal financial reporting, financial analysis and planning, and tax of individual companies. As an example, working in the finance and accounting department of Amazon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, the roles will all have varying levels of responsibility, technical expertise, and workload.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, company size, industry, corporate structure, company maturity, management style, and location all have impacts on the overall culture and work environment of a company.&nbsp;\u201c</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-cd31b70cc1cd81df8eeb8662eb81886d\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>What are common causes of burnout among accountants, and how can they be addressed</strong>?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p data-slot-rendered-content=\"true\">\u201c<strong>1.</strong> <strong>Long work hours</strong></p>\n<div class=\"mv-ad-box\" data-slotid=\"content_2_btf\" style=\"height: 250px; width: max(300px, 100%); overflow: clip !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-frame-250\" data-slotid=\"content_2_btf\" style=\"overflow: visible !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-slide-250\" data-slotid=\"content_2_btf\" style=\"overflow: visible !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-sticky-250\" data-slotid=\"content_2_btf\"><div id=\"content_2_btf_wrapper\" class=\"adunitwrapper content_btf_wrapper\" data-wrapper=\"content_2_btf\" data-nosnippet=\"\">\n          <div id=\"content_2_btf\" class=\"content_btf adunit\">\n            \n          </div>\n        </div><mv-ad-reporter data-slot-id=\"content_2_btf\" data-offering=\"1\" data-offering-name=\"mediavine\" data-offering-domain=\"mediavine.com\"></mv-ad-reporter></div></div></div>\n  \n        \n    \n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>Overextended working hours are a common cause of burnout among accountants. Especially during the tax season / busy season. There are high demands for accountants to complete their work within tight deadlines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Tax and accounting updates</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are often updates to accounting and tax policies which require extra time to address.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As work is complex, more time is required to ensure that the reporting is accurate and effective. Short cutting in accounting can lead to more issues in the future.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, when companies change accounting reporting frameworks as part of restructuring, consolidations, mergers, and acquisitions, additional work is required to update the reporting. This is not just limited to accounting and taxes and can also be an entire IT infrastructure overhaul.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Short staffed</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Short staffed organizations and firms result in individual team members having to take on more work than they were initially expected to complete. If hiring cannot keep up with the demands of the work, teams will have to take on the load by doing over time hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an overall accounting shortage as there are fewer students enrolling into the CPA program. Supply of skilled accountants is falling behind the demand for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pay is relatively low at the start of your career in accounting. Of course with time your compensation will increase. However, in order to become a CPA, you will also have to complete CPA education requirements after completing your undergraduate or diploma in accounting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These courses are usually taken while working full time. This leads to high demands for articling accountants. In addition, there is a financial cost for Canadian accountants to take their exams.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cThe CPA Professional Education Program (CPA PEP) costs* approximately $13,427.5 + GST. This does not include the cost of taking any prerequisite courses that may be required for entry into CPA PEP.\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.cpawsb.ca/future-learners/certification-program-overview/program-cost-and-expenses/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">CPA Canada</a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most Big 4 accounting firms will cover the cost of this tuition. However, there are typically claw back clauses which may require candidates to pay back all or a partial portion of the tuition reimbursements unless they complete 1 to 2 years of work experience with the employer since paying for the dues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Effective communication within teams and with clients can be beneficial in identifying how to use time most effectively. Collaboration and teamwork can lead to efficiency gains, however, it will not solve the problem in its entirety.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-1120b981\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-f2a3c051\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-f2a3c051\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-e68b4b92\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-57d81be7\">\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-cacf9b9ed6cc6cdd53cf5207920e284e\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>How feasible is it for accountants to maintain a work-life balance while pursuing career advancement?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cCreating work life balance is personal and dependent on the lifestyle, responsibilities, and priorities of an individual. Yes, accountants are known to have long hours, but this is not true for every accounting role in the profession. It is important to identify your personal capacity for high demand work and overtime hours. If you are reaching the edge of your capacity, I would typically recommend considering finding a new role or finding a better way to manage the work and stress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If prioritizing work-life balance is a high priority, I do believe there are ways to create a meaningful balance without having to sacrifice your career progression. This includes improving time management and productivity, communication with clients and team members, boundaries, and focus.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-0f4f12cd01e7c5af171ab338406fcc71\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Are there some common misconceptions about the accounting profession that you\u2019d like to dispel?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt the accounting stigmas and misconceptions when I started my accounting education in university.

There are a set of very specific guidelines that you need to follow to become a CPA. Many new CPAs will expect that the rest of their careers will look and feel the same. They may expect that a path would be set out for them for career growth and advancement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead they are faced with a reality that there is not \u201cbest\u201d CPA career path out there. In fact, there can seem like there are too many options and opportunities that can result in action paralysis and stagnation in career growth. New CPAs may expect that they will receive promotions and increase in responsibilities just because they have been with a company for longer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Career advancement is an active process. And though CPAs go through the same training process, their individual strengths, values,&nbsp; interests, and motivations will vary. As such, it is very important to start to identify strengths that set you apart from other accountants.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asking for feedback is a highly effective way to get a sense of strengths in the workplace. I would recommend having open and honest feedback conversations with your manager(s), colleagues, and clients to get a clearer sense of what is working for you and what is not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking feedback in an objective and constructive way can be challenging at times, especially when there seems to be no time to reflect on their work. However, feedback can help you identify what you are good at and why.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can have tendencies to overlook our strengths because they seem natural and easy to us. We can downplay our abilities when we are not getting feedback from those around us.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-link-color has-medium-font-size wp-elements-9422672126c1ea02e952c7578555e1a6\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>What are some key transferable skills that accountants and CPAs can employ when exploring career opportunities outside of traditional accounting roles?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-8710327c\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-8710327c\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-7960b80c\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-c1c9c825\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-ba1da361\">\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n\n\n<iframe class=\"instagram-media\" id=\"instagram-embed-0\" src=\"https://www.instagram.com/reel/Ch7i8KNJ0-Q/embed/?cr=1&amp;v=14&amp;wp=585&amp;rd=https%3A%2F%2Fcareersidekick.com&amp;rp=%2Fthe-career-coach-chronicles-advice-from-casey-chung%2F#%7B%22ci%22%3A0%2C%22os%22%3A1634.7000000476837%2C%22ls%22%3A348.7999999523163%2C%22le%22%3A348.7999999523163%7D\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"0\" data-instgrm-payload-id=\"instagram-media-payload-0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"background: white;

The completion of the CPA is very rewarding. The designation and the training associated with it expands your skill set as an accountant and a business person. CPAs can open doors towards going more in depth in the field of accounting or branching out to other areas of business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many, getting further education is a way to ensure long term employment and job security. I could not agree more with this statement, especially in the accounting field. Accountants are high in demand and there is no shortage of jobs available on the market right now. The challenge would be to find the role that fits your career development goals and personal interests. As there are so many opportunities available, there can be information overload.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acquiring your CPA does take time and commitment and I would not recommend it to everyone. If you are ready to commit yourself to the education for a few years and have the resources and the time to do so, I would encourage it. Many CPA students have their eyes set on completing the education component of the designation and overlook the longer term career development opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I encourage you to think 5 years ahead while you are either considering starting the designation or are already enrolled in it. If you become too focused on the exams, you may miss the bigger picture purpose of you embarking on the journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I often see recent exam passers become demotivated, exhausted, and lost after completing their education. They have forgotten why they have started the journey in the first place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are feeling confident in your intention to obtain your CPA, go for it. Gather support and mentorship. Go all in. If you are on the fence about the profession, go talk to more people and consider your 5 year career plan before committing.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>What steps should accountants take to develop a clear and actionable career progression plan?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIf you are reading this article, you are likely starting to consider how you can progress further in your career. There is no \u201cright\u201d career path as we are all different and unique individuals and possess a variety of skills and experiences. I usually point people to look both inwards and outwards for clues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inwards would include self reflection, identification of strengths, weaknesses, values, interests, and passions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outward would include anything external like job performance, opportunities in the market, job postings, industry research, networking, etc.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I\u2019ll provide a high level plan that accountants can take to develop a clear and actionable career plan.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Define your definition of success (what your ideal lifestyle and how your career fits into it).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Identify your values, strengths, and interests.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Clarify your 5 year, 1 year, and 6 month goal.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Identify 1-3 opportunities/options that get you closer to achieving your 1 year goal.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Create an action plan for each of the opportunities. Include deadlines and specific measures of success.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Implement the action plan.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I recommend finding a mentor or coach to work with on staying accountable and committed to your plans. Having an outside voice is very beneficial in helping you overcome obstacles and internal limitations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are interested in the full framework you can contact me!\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>How important is mentorship in the career development of accountants, and how can one find a suitable mentor?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cMentorship is very important in the accounting profession. I\u2019ve worked with multiple mentors throughout my career. Each of my mentors played different and unique roles. My mentors have helped me start my career, decide between jobs, steer me in directions towards further education, get involved with volunteer organizations, pass exams, and stay motivated during challenging times.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some organizations and firms will have mentorship relationships built into their organization. And CPA Canada requires CPA candidates to work with mentors while working towards their designation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Though there are systems in place for mentorship, some relationships can slip through the crack.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding a mentor or coach is extremely important for long term career development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mentorship relationships are two way relationships. Professionals without mentors may not know where to start. They may think that mentors will not have time to spend on helping.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact is, there is no shortage of accountants who want to help others. This field is full of support. We just have to ask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve created mentor relationships at coffee shops, formal and informal networking events, webinars, online discussions, LinkedIn messages, workshops, on the job, at school, and even in sport leagues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do not underestimate the power of connection.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>What role does networking play in uncovering hidden career opportunities in the accounting sector?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cNetworking is extremely important in the accounting industry. I started my career before the dominance of <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/social-media-influencer/\">social media</a> and online connection. Networking with industry professionals was the best way to gather insights and information on potential roles, opportunities, and learning. Today, we may think of going to a company\u2019s social media page or website for insights, however it will not give you a full picture of what the company has to offer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Networking can help you recognize how you can apply your skills and knowledge in other domains of business. What might seem like a routine task and skill in your current workplace may be recognized as an invaluable skill to another organization.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I notice this often with accountants who have been in roles for multiple years. They seem to have capped out on their career development within the firm. This can result in a lack of fulfillment and decrease in engagement and productivity. In other words, the job has become too repetitive or routine. For some this works, but for those who are inspired and motivated to grow in their careers, they may need to seek outside opportunities for growth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Networking plays a pivotal role in career advancement. I often notice job seekers gather stronger and more interesting opportunities from finding opportunities through their network, rather than going onto online job boards.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all opportunities live on job boards. If you are not networking and utilizing your network, you are missing out of opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some candidates will say \u201cI don\u2019t have a network so I can only apply to jobs on job boards.\u201d I usually reply with \u201cHow can you grow your network?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This nudges the candidate toward solution seeking instead of getting blocked by limitation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately we do have online channels to connect with local and professionals from around the world.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:15px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-color has-medium-font-size\" style=\"color:#115266\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>How do you see the field of accounting evolving in the future, particularly with trends like automation and the integration of artificial intelligence? How might these changes impact the traditional role of accountants?</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAccountants will continue to be relevant and important in the financial sector as technology continues to evolve. There are fears that AI and technology will take over the jobs of accountants. Though this is true, there are some types of roles that are more impacted than others. Transactional and operational functions of bookkeeping, tax compliance, financial analysis and reporting are already being improved with automation, trend analysis, and error detection. Accountants who work in these functions will be able to utilize these technologies to improve their output and productivity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accountants with technological advantages will be able to process more transactions and reports compared to those without advanced technology. Likewise, the skill set of accountants will need to shift towards competency in data analysis and information systems in addition to technical accounting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New technology can also lead to more innovation, strategic, and value added work generated by accountants, beyond compliance and transactional work.\u201d</p>\n\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mv-ad-box\" data-slotid=\"content_7_btf\" style=\"height: 250px; width: max(300px, 100%); overflow: clip !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-frame-250\" data-slotid=\"content_7_btf\" style=\"overflow: visible !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-slide-250\" data-slotid=\"content_7_btf\" style=\"overflow: visible !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-sticky-250\" data-slotid=\"content_7_btf\"><div id=\"content_7_btf_wrapper\" class=\"adunitwrapper content_btf_wrapper\" data-wrapper=\"content_7_btf\" data-nosnippet=\"\">\n          <div id=\"content_7_btf\" class=\"content_btf adunit\">\n            \n          </div>\n        </div><mv-ad-reporter data-slot-id=\"content_7_btf\" data-offering=\"1\" data-offering-name=\"mediavine\" data-offering-domain=\"mediavine.com\"></mv-ad-reporter></div></div></div>\n  \n        \n    \n</div>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-a4ef04f8\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-ba57e0f0\">\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\">\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-2fa6622f gb-headline-text\"><strong>Want more expert insights?

So, be clear and direct about why you\u2019re following up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t be timid. However, you should be polite and respectful, no matter how long you\u2019ve been waiting. Follow these tips to keep your email short, sweet, and professional, and leave a lasting impression on the interviewer:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Start with a friendly greeting</strong>: Be sure to mention the interviewer\u2019s first name.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Say thanks for the opportunity: </strong>Before asking about the status it\u2019s always a good idea to express your gratitude for the interviewer\u2019s time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Reaffirm your interest in the position</strong>: Here\u2019s where you can mention any notable takeaways from the interview or reinforce some reasons why you\u2019re a great fit for the role. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ask directly for an update</strong>:  Say you look forward to hearing about the next steps.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Finish by thanking them once </strong>more before signing off with your first and last name.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Send and be patient</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>That last point is critical.

You shouldn\u2019t feel too disappointed if you don\u2019t hear back in the first few days. The hiring manager hasn\u2019t forgotten you; they\u2019re dealing with other responsibilities. Keep your chin up and continue applying for jobs that interest you in case this one doesn\u2019t work out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below are some basic etiquettes of post-interview follow-up emails:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Show Gratitude</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After greeting the hiring manager or interviewer by their name, you should thank them for taking the time to interview you. I\u2019d mention the specific date you spoke to remind them, too. You\u2019re trying to make a positive impression on the recruiter, and gratitude is always a key element in making that positive impression. For example: \u201c<em>Dear Jeff, thank you for taking the time to meet with me on Thursday.</em>\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Keep It Professional&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like any work-related email, you should keep your follow-up email as formal as possible. Keeping it professional entails starting with an appropriate <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/the-best-email-subject-lines-for-getting-noticed/\">subject line</a> and having a professional closing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, there is always the option of matching a company\u2019s brand tone, especially if it is a tad laid-back. However, you will be on the safer side by maintaining a professional and formal tone in follow-ups. According to <a href=\"https://builtin.com/articles/how-to-follow-up-after-an-interview#:~:text=%E2%80%9CIt%E2%80%99s%20okay%20to%20tone%20match%2C%20but%20you%20also%20want%20to%20level%20up%20a%20little%20bit%20with%20professionalism%2C%E2%80%9D%20Khine%20said.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mollie Khine</a>, VP of Learning and Community at Flatiron School, \u201cIt\u2019s okay to tone match, but you also want to level up a little bit with professionalism.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Make it Meaningful</h3>\n\n\n\n<p data-slot-rendered-content=\"true\">Making the email meaningful could mean adding the key takeaways from the interview or even the most interesting aspects of the job. Referencing these specifics helps the recruiter remember you easily.</p>\n<div class=\"mv-ad-box\" data-slotid=\"content_8_btf\" style=\"height: 250px; width: max(300px, 100%); overflow: clip !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-frame-250\" data-slotid=\"content_8_btf\" style=\"overflow: visible !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-slide-250\" data-slotid=\"content_8_btf\" style=\"overflow: visible !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-sticky-250\" data-slotid=\"content_8_btf\"><div id=\"content_8_btf_wrapper\" class=\"adunitwrapper content_btf_wrapper\" data-wrapper=\"content_8_btf\" data-nosnippet=\"\">\n          <div id=\"content_8_btf\" class=\"content_btf adunit\">\n            \n          </div>\n        </div><mv-ad-reporter data-slot-id=\"content_8_btf\" data-offering=\"1\" data-offering-name=\"mediavine\" data-offering-domain=\"mediavine.com\"></mv-ad-reporter></div></div></div>\n  \n        \n    \n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/how-can-you-write-follow-up-emails-get-results-ppiue\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Jordan Campbell</a>, technical recruiter at IBISKA, said, \u201cWe\u2019ll meet a lot of people; so when following up with a recruiter after a job fair, it\u2019s a good idea to try to bring up something specific about your meeting in your message to jog their memory.\u201d This applies to follow-up emails sent after interviews, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Proofread Before Sending</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although your follow-up email isn\u2019t your first impression, you still shouldn\u2019t send it out without checking for grammar, spelling, and punctuation. When proofreading, be sure to weed out overly casual punctuations like interrobangs. A well-written, error-free email reflects your professionalism and attention to detail.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Handle Silence</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your interview follow-up email is no guarantee that you\u2019ll get a response. Sometimes, it will be total radio silence from the recruiter\u2019s side. This is no fault of yours; it just wasn\u2019t meant to be. In your job-seeking journey, silence is a part you must learn to handle.

Rather than taking the non-response personally, you can use it as an opportunity to demonstrate your written communication skills and send a quick follow-up email to check in on the status of your candidacy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re interviewing with other companies and have updates on your status, you can also include this information in your email to the recruiter, hiring manager, or HR department.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Practice Self Care and Stay Positive</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s always that feeling of disappointment that comes with not getting any feedback from a recruiter. However, you need to take care of your mental and physical well-being. Engaging in activities that you enjoy and that help you relax can improve your overall mood and resilience during this period. The silence from the recruiter isn\u2019t something you can control. Nonetheless, you can control your reaction and maintain a positive outlook.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reflect on Your Interview</h3>\n\n\n\n<p data-slot-rendered-content=\"true\">Reflect on your interview performance to identify areas for improvement and achievements you might have omitted. Take note of what went well and areas for improvement. Use this reflection not to dwell on past mistakes but to prepare for better communication and to identify skill gaps to address.</p>\n<div class=\"mv-ad-box\" data-slotid=\"content_9_btf\" style=\"height: 250px; width: max(300px, 100%); overflow: clip !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-frame-250\" data-slotid=\"content_9_btf\" style=\"overflow: visible !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-slide-250\" data-slotid=\"content_9_btf\" style=\"overflow: visible !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-sticky-250\" data-slotid=\"content_9_btf\"><div id=\"content_9_btf_wrapper\" class=\"adunitwrapper content_btf_wrapper\" data-wrapper=\"content_9_btf\" data-nosnippet=\"\">\n          <div id=\"content_9_btf\" class=\"content_btf adunit\">\n            \n          </div>\n        </div><mv-ad-reporter data-slot-id=\"content_9_btf\" data-offering=\"1\" data-offering-name=\"mediavine\" data-offering-domain=\"mediavine.com\"></mv-ad-reporter></div></div></div>\n  \n        \n    \n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/advice/1/whats-best-way-handle-post-interview-rejection-silence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mei Yu Lim</a>, technical recruiter at Microsoft, emphasizes the value of reflection: \u201cBeing reflective helps. You can recheck the company and the role you have applied for and interviewed. Revisit the job description, identify the key competencies and traits for the role if you haven\u2019t already done so and reflect if you have demonstrated the ideal competencies and traits the hiring manager or the interviewer is looking out for.\u201c</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Apply to Other Jobs</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For the vast majority, job-hunting is a marathon, not a sprint. Stay resilient and keep up the momentum by seeking out new roles that match your skill set. While waiting for responses, diversifying your applications can reduce the emotional weight of any single application\u2019s outcome. Check out this <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/job-search-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">article</a> on job-seeking tips and techniques that can improve your chances of getting hired. This <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-say-in-a-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">article</a> contains interview preparation and tips for various industries to help you ace your next interview.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Effectively Managing Multiple Interviews and Applications</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep in mind that delays happen, and the hiring process takes time. So, the best thing for you to do while waiting for a status update is apply for more jobs and try to schedule more interviews. You shouldn\u2019t stop doing this until you\u2019ve signed a job offer! No matter how well you write your follow-up email, it isn\u2019t going to get a company to move its process faster, bypass delays, or skip over other candidates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While applying to multiple jobs, you will inevitably have to manage multiple follow-ups. Here are strategies to help you stay on top of your game:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use a Tracking System</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Create a spreadsheet or use a job search management tool to track each job application, interview dates, follow-up actions, and any responses received. Include columns for the company name, position, date of application, interview date, notes from the interview, and follow-up dates. This system will help you quickly see which jobs you need to follow up on and when.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Prioritize Your Opportunities</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Rank your job opportunities based on your level of interest, the likelihood of getting the job, and how well it matches your career goals. Focus your energy on the highest-priority follow-ups, but don\u2019t neglect the others. This approach ensures you allocate your time and resources effectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Set Reminders</h3>\n\n\n\n<p data-slot-rendered-content=\"true\">Use digital calendars, apps, or the reminder system within your tracking tool to set alerts for when it\u2019s time to send a follow-up email. Timing is key in maintaining a professional image and showing your interest without being overbearing.</p>\n<div class=\"mv-ad-box\" data-slotid=\"content_10_btf\" style=\"height: 250px; width: max(300px, 100%); overflow: clip !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-frame-250\" data-slotid=\"content_10_btf\" style=\"overflow: visible !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-slide-250\" data-slotid=\"content_10_btf\" style=\"overflow: visible !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-sticky-250\" data-slotid=\"content_10_btf\"><div id=\"content_10_btf_wrapper\" class=\"adunitwrapper content_btf_wrapper\" data-wrapper=\"content_10_btf\" data-nosnippet=\"\">\n          <div id=\"content_10_btf\" class=\"content_btf adunit\">\n            \n          </div>\n        </div><mv-ad-reporter data-slot-id=\"content_10_btf\" data-offering=\"1\" data-offering-name=\"mediavine\" data-offering-domain=\"mediavine.com\"></mv-ad-reporter></div></div></div>\n  \n        \n    \n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don\u2019t Hesitate to Move On</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The average response time after an interview is <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/average-response-time-after-interview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">24 business days</a>. This means you may sometimes need a second follow-up email if the first one goes unanswered. However, if you\u2019ve followed up a couple of times with no response, it might be time to focus your energies elsewhere. It\u2019s important to recognize when it\u2019s time to let go and redirect your efforts to other opportunities.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-33d7847d\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-e6adffce\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-34cbb528\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-34cbb528\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-5db80e85\">\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-base-2-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-base-2-background-color has-background\">\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-0ec43197\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-2e6a8c4d\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-7b1c6b54\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-7b1c6b54\">\n\n<figure class=\"gb-block-image gb-block-image-8796466a\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"503\" height=\"496\" class=\"gb-image gb-image-8796466a perfmatters-lazy\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='503'%20height='496'%20viewBox='0%200%20503%20496'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"picture of Biron Clark\" title=\"Biron-Clark-meet-team\" data-src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1.png 503w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1-300x296.png 300w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"503\" height=\"496\" class=\"gb-image gb-image-8796466a\" src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1.png\" alt=\"picture of Biron Clark\" title=\"Biron-Clark-meet-team\" srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1.png 503w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1-300x296.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\" /></noscript></figure>\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-6d502a65\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-6d502a65\">\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-aefdd19e gb-headline-text\"><strong>About the Author</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-2630df48 gb-headline-text\">Biron Clark is a former executive recruiter who has worked individually with hundreds of job seekers, reviewed thousands of resumes and LinkedIn profiles, and recruited for top venture-backed startups and Fortune 500 companies.

First, employers want to gauge your level of interest and motivation for the specific role and company. Your answer helps them determine if you genuinely desire the position or if you\u2019re just looking for any job.&nbsp;<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employers don\u2019t want to hire a candidate who\u2019s applying to every job they can find online. They want someone who\u2019s <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-are-your-career-goals/\">thought about their career goals</a> and wants a specific type of job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your answer to this question demonstrates that you\u2019ve thoroughly reviewed the job description and know what the role entails.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. They don\u2019t want to hire somebody who doesn\u2019t know much about their particular job or didn\u2019t do any <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/research-company-before-job-interview/\">research before the interview</a> because it shows them you either don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking for or are desperate and don\u2019t care.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Understanding why you\u2019re applying provides insight into how well you\u2019d integrate into the <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-is-company-culture-how-to-improve-yours/\">company culture</a>. Employers seek candidates whose values align with the organization\u2019s culture and mission.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>Your answer will also help them assess if you\u2019re likely to stay with the organization for a reasonable amount of time, reducing turnover and increasing stability within the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to Answer \u201cWhy Are You Applying For This Position?\u201d</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s delve into some strategies to master how to answer \u201cWhy are you applying for this position?\u201d</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-2c847b9d\" data-slot-rendered-content=\"true\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-d41991e0\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-e7ae6eaf\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-e7ae6eaf\">\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-b64ae587\"><span class=\"gb-icon\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\" height=\"1em\" width=\"1em\" viewBox=\"0 0 496 512\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M248 8C111.03 8 0 119.03 0 256s111.03 248 248 248 248-111.03 248-248S384.97 8 248 8zm0 432c-101.69 0-184-82.29-184-184 0-101.69 82.29-184 184-184 101.69 0 184 82.29 184 184 0 101.69-82.29 184-184 184zm0-312c-70.69 0-128 57.31-128 128s57.31 128 128 128 128-57.31 128-128-57.31-128-128-128zm0 192c-35.29 0-64-28.71-64-64s28.71-64 64-64 64 28.71 64 64-28.71 64-64 64z\"></path></svg></span><span class=\"gb-headline-text\"><strong>EXPERT ADVICE </strong></span></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-08e330c1 gb-headline-text\">Allign Your Career Goals with Company Objectives</h3>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-b5b9b159 gb-headline-text\"><em>To really impress in your interview, show how your career goals line up with that the company is all about. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Think about your unique skills and how they can help the company grow.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Share real examples and be genuine \u2013 this will make you stand out as the candidate they need.</em></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-144caabd\">\n\n<figure class=\"gb-block-image gb-block-image-9aa3395b\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"290\" height=\"290\" class=\"gb-image gb-image-9aa3395b perfmatters-lazy\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='290'%20height='290'%20viewBox='0%200%20290%20290'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chelsea Jay\" data-src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Chelsea-Jay-290x290.png\" data-srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Chelsea-Jay-290x290.png 290w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Chelsea-Jay-300x300.png 300w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Chelsea-Jay.png 483w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"290\" height=\"290\" class=\"gb-image gb-image-9aa3395b\" src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Chelsea-Jay-290x290.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Chelsea Jay\" srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Chelsea-Jay-290x290.png 290w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Chelsea-Jay-300x300.png 300w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Chelsea-Jay.png 483w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" /></noscript></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left has-small-font-size\">Chelsea Jay, Career &amp; Leadership Coach<br><a href=\"https://seasonedandgrowing.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">https://seasonedandgrowing.com/</a></p>\n\n</div>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-532a5d09\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-532a5d09\">\n\n<iframe width=\"352\" height=\"626\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Pq0FWK1kiA\" title=\"How to Answer 'Why Did You Apply for This Position?'

With a background in project management and strategic planning, I am confident in my ability to adapt and excel in this new environment.\u201d</em></p>\n\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Now, before we wrap up, let\u2019s cover a few mistakes and traps to avoid when answering\u2026 \u201cWhy did you decide to apply for this position?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Common Mistakes to Avoid When Answering \u201cWhy Did You Apply For This Job?\u201d</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a couple of things you definitely shouldn\u2019t do when the interviewer asks why you applied for their job.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what not to do\u2026</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\" data-slot-rendered-content=\"true\">\n<li>Don\u2019t make it seem like you don\u2019t care what type of job you get or that you\u2019ve applied for every position out there.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You should never enter an interview without knowing what the company does, its mission, values, etc. If you don\u2019t know this stuff, you don\u2019t deserve the job (<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/why-cant-i-find-a-job/\">and you probably won\u2019t get it</a>).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Don\u2019t tell them you don\u2019t know or aren\u2019t sure.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Never give an answer or reason that\u2019s about your personal needs\u2026 like needing more money, a shorter commute, etc. Keep it focused on the company\u2019s needs and your career growth (try to balance both). That\u2019s it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Don\u2019t overlook the opportunity to connect your skills, experiences, and career goals with what the job entails.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Never badmouth your previous or current company. Talk about the positives you want to GAIN in your next job, not what you\u2019re looking to escape in your current job if you have one. That\u2019s a rule you can follow in any <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-say-in-a-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\">interview answers</a> you give.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"mv-ad-box\" data-slotid=\"content_9_btf\" style=\"height: 250px; width: max(300px, 100%); overflow: clip !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-frame-250\" data-slotid=\"content_9_btf\" style=\"overflow: visible !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-slide-250\" data-slotid=\"content_9_btf\" style=\"overflow: visible !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-sticky-250\" data-slotid=\"content_9_btf\"><div id=\"content_9_btf_wrapper\" class=\"adunitwrapper content_btf_wrapper\" data-wrapper=\"content_9_btf\" data-nosnippet=\"\">\n          <div id=\"content_9_btf\" class=\"content_btf adunit\">\n            \n          </div>\n        </div><mv-ad-reporter data-slot-id=\"content_9_btf\" data-offering=\"1\" data-offering-name=\"mediavine\" data-offering-domain=\"mediavine.com\"></mv-ad-reporter></div></div></div>\n  \n        \n    \n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sample Answers to Avoid</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>1. <em>\u201cI feel that this job would look great on my resume when I apply at &lt;anothercompanyname&gt; at the end of next year.\u201d</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why this doesn\u2019t work: </strong>By indicating that you see this role as a stepping stone to another position, you indicate that you don\u2019t view this company as highly as the other and that you don\u2019t intend to stay in the role for long. Onboarding costs money, so it makes no sense to hire someone who\u2019ll be in and out again after a year or two.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>2.<em>\u201cI\u2019m applying for this role because of the benefits you offer, the pay, and the high number of paid annual leave days.\u201d</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why this doesn\u2019t work: </strong>This answer indicates that the company and the role are not a priority for you. Instead, you are thinking of days off before the work even begins and you are thinking of all you have to gain instead of what you can give to the role. We all value benefits and a good income, but employment is not a one-way street. To reap the rewards, you need to put in the effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>3. <em>\u201cI\u2019ve applied because I\u2019ve got all the skills and qualifications listed in your job description.\u201d&nbsp;</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why this doesn\u2019t work: </strong>On the surface, this seems like an obvious and acceptable answer, however, it\u2019s important to remember that this is the answer that most applicants would give \u2013 and you\u2019re NOT trying to blend in with the crowd. Be unique and highlight aspirations and goals that make YOU perfect for this role, but also show some company knowledge to prove that you\u2019re not just looking for any similar role at any company.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>More Interview Resources </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-do-you-know-about-our-company/\" data-type=\"post\" data-id=\"17447\">What Do You Know About Our Company?

Applicants can easily get lost in the details of the challenge. You can use the <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/acing-your-next-job-interview-with-the-star-method/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">STAR method</a> to structure your response. This stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result. The <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/acing-your-next-job-interview-with-the-star-method/\">STAR</a> method ensures you focus on the key elements: the situation you faced, the specific task or goal, the actions you took to overcome it, and the positive results you achieved.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep Your Answer Concise</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While it\u2019s tempting to share every detail, it\u2019s important to keep your answer concise. Although applicants are generally advised to keep their <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-say-in-a-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\">interview answers</a> limited to 30 seconds, you can take a bit more time (<a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/how-long-should-interview-answers-be#:~:text=Your%20response%20may%20be%20longer%20(two%20to%20four%20minutes)%20if%20the%20inquiry%20is%20complex%2C%20which%20is%20common%20for%20behavioral%20questions%20or%20in%2Ddepth%20questions%20about%20your%20experience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">two to four minutes</a>) for <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/common-job-interview-questions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">behavioral questions</a> like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Focus on the key points of how you handled the situation, providing just enough information to illustrate your capabilities without overwhelming the interviewer.

Such experiences also enhance your interpersonal skills as you build new relationships and collaborate with diverse groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sample Answer</strong></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-38388d27 box-shadow\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-07dbe927\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"556\" height=\"192\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='556'%20height='192'%20viewBox='0%200%20556%20192'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82801 perfmatters-lazy\" style=\"width:197px\" data-src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.png\" data-srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.png 556w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4-300x104.png 300w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"556\" height=\"192\" src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82801\" style=\"width:197px\" srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.png 556w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4-300x104.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\" /></noscript></a></figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>\u201c<em>When I moved to Japan for work, I was immediately faced with the challenges of adapting to a completely different culture and learning a new language.

Don\u2019t just describe the challenge.&nbsp; Explain how you overcame it and what skills you developed in the process.&nbsp; Highlight your learning and growth mindset.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Making it Too Personal</strong>: While some personal adversities are okay (focusing on transferable skills developed), avoid overly sensitive topics or anything that wouldn\u2019t be appropriate in a professional setting.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Blaming Others</strong>: Blaming others paints a picture of someone who struggles with accountability and may not be willing to take responsibility for their actions. Focus on your own actions and how you overcame the challenge.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">More Interview Resources</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking to learn more?

But fret not! By approaching it strategically, you can turn it into an opportunity to showcase your self-awareness and commitment to growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are my top tips on how to answer:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. <strong>Identify an Area for Improvement (Choose Wisely)</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When hiring managers ask <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-say-in-a-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">interview questions</a> about areas of improvement, they want to really hear something legitimate that you\u2019d like to improve and feel you could improve upon. E.g., a skill you\u2019re actively developing, a soft skill you can strengthen, or a tool or technology you\u2019re learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure to select a weakness that won\u2019t significantly impact your ability to perform the job. For example, if this is a supervisor position, don\u2019t say you need to improve your <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/300466\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">communication skills</a> or get better at delegating tasks. Those are vital pieces of a supervisor\u2019s role, and the hiring manager is going to have serious concerns about your ability to lead if you give that type of answer when they ask about your areas for improvement.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-37ad1fc6\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-5c504ca9\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-47dfbd42\">\n<div

Or maybe you think your reason is solid, but you want to double-check its effectiveness. Either way, I\u2019ve got you covered.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/careers-recruiter/\">recruiter</a> who has guided many through this question, I\u2019m going to share 10 safe, proven answers you can use when your interviewer asks this inevitable question.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-23ee4ae9\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-d35f5dca\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-aee72f4c\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-aee72f4c\">\n\n<h5 class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-b44e51eb gb-headline-text\"><strong>Highlights</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"has-small-font-size wp-block-list\">\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Explain your reasons for leaving your last job in a way that highlights personal growth and readiness for new opportunities.</li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Shape your explanation to underscore how your skills and experiences make you a suitable candidate for the position you\u2019re applying for.</li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Use a voice recorder to practice your response, ensuring it sounds confident and hits all the key points you want to convey.</li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">If you left under difficult circumstances, focus on your proactive steps towards personal and professional development since then.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Do Employers Ask \u201cWhy Did You Leave Your Last Job?\u201d</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From my experience as a recruiter, <strong>hiring managers seek to learn three things when they ask this question:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, they want to determine whether you\u2019re a good fit for their role and if you would integrate well within the <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-is-company-culture-how-to-improve-yours/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">company culture</a> and team. They want to ensure that hiring you won\u2019t waste their time and efforts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, they want to understand whether the reason you left could apply to their organization. For instance, if you left because you didn\u2019t feel challenged, there\u2019s a chance the same feeling may crop up again in the new role. They want to determine if your reasons for leaving align with what their company can offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the hiring manager wants to know whether your prior employer fired you. This helps gauge your stability and reliability as an employee. <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/explain-being-fired/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">If you were fired</a>, be prepared to answer why, as this can be a red flag to recruiters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-37ad1fc6\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-5c504ca9\">\n<div

The key here is to answer honestly and alleviate their worries that you might be a potential flight risk without going into unnecessary details.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you left a company because of a layoff, you could explain that you were part of a reduction in force, along with XX% of colleagues, and then pivot toward why you\u2019re drawn to this future company.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong>How to Answer \u201cWhy Did You Leave Your Last Job?\u201d</strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While talking about your last position may feel uncomfortable, expect it to come up in an interview. Recruiters want to understand their candidates as much as possible before hiring them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Prepare in Advance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before your interview, list the reasons you left your last job. For example, you might have felt that the role didn\u2019t give you upward mobility or didn\u2019t allow you a chance to use your skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you have a reason for why you left your last job that you\u2019re comfortable sharing in an interview, make sure to practice a few times. I\u2019d recommend recording yourself talking on your smartphone voice recorder app (every modern phone has one).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t have to memorize your <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-say-in-a-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">interview answer</a> word-for-word. Just make sure you sound confident and relaxed and are hitting the key points that you want to mention as you explain why you left your previous job.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. <strong>Don\u2019t Badmouth</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You should be very careful not to speak about your previous management team in a negative light. Speaking adversely about your employer can get back to them, and it reflects poorly on you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you left your employer under unfavorable circumstances, frame your answer in a positive light, focusing on what you gained from the experience rather than any negative aspects (more about this in the section below).If you seem stubborn or unwilling to learn from the past, you\u2019ll <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/why-cant-i-find-a-job/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">struggle to get a job</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. <strong>Be Honest</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, keep your answer brief and honest. Recruiters interview many people and can usually spot when someone isn\u2019t being truthful. To avoid future negative ramifications, be on the safe side and keep your answer tactful but candid.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-d87174ff\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-3707d953\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-936929cf\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-54888dc3\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-54888dc3\">\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-f873d2c8\"><span class=\"gb-icon\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 666 666\" height=\"1em\" width=\"1em\">     <path fill=\"#115266\" d=\"M333 100.566C461.285 100.566 565.434 204.715 565.434 333C565.434 461.285 461.285 565.434 333 565.434H100.566V333C100.566 204.715 204.715 100.566 333 100.566Z\"></path>     <path fill=\"#66B4DD\" d=\"M405.062 390.156C395.937 401.691 385.748 410.549 374.479 416.716C363.21 422.897 349.93 425.974 334.625 425.974C322.011 425.974 310.276 423.829 299.407 419.54C288.552 415.251 279.081 409.071 271.036 401.025C265.734 395.724 261.179 389.743 257.383 383.083C255.425 379.633 253.666 376.024 252.121 372.241C247.553 361.118 245.275 348.704 245.275 335.011C245.275 321.318 247.553 308.917 252.121 297.782C256.677 286.646 262.99 277.056 271.036 269.011C275.125 264.921 279.574 261.325 284.382 258.208C284.489 258.128 284.609 258.062 284.715 257.995C289.284 255.051 294.186 252.561 299.407 250.496C310.276 246.207 322.011 244.049 334.625 244.049C349.118 244.049 361.598 246.939 372.068 252.707C382.524 258.475 391.515 265.654 399.028 274.232L442.904 231.568C428.678 216.277 412.92 204.609 395.604 196.563C378.302 188.505 357.842 184.482 334.226 184.482C312.754 184.482 292.774 188.371 274.259 196.15C261.472 201.532 249.857 208.285 239.441 216.437C239.414 216.45 239.374 216.463 239.347 216.503C235.858 219.234 231.222 223.11 226.161 228.158C212.601 241.705 201.945 257.609 194.166 275.844C186.374 294.092 182.484 313.819 182.484 335.011C182.484 356.203 186.374 375.944 194.166 394.179C195.152 396.483 196.177 398.761 197.256 400.985C198.335 403.223 199.454 405.421 200.626 407.579L200.64 407.605C207.526 420.339 216.037 431.768 226.161 441.878C239.707 455.424 255.744 466.093 274.259 473.872C292.774 481.651 312.754 485.554 334.226 485.554C381.725 485.554 420.22 467.838 449.75 432.421L405.062 390.156Z\"></path>     <path fill=\"#6AD4DB\" d=\"M284.715 257.995C284.609 258.062 284.489 258.128 284.382 258.208C279.574 261.325 275.125 264.921 271.036 269.011C262.99 277.056 256.677 286.646 252.121 297.782C247.553 308.917 245.275 321.332 245.275 335.011C245.275 348.691 247.553 361.119 252.121 372.241C253.666 376.024 255.425 379.633 257.383 383.07C245.062 381.458 232.741 379.846 220.42 378.221C213.826 388.012 207.233 397.788 200.626 407.579C199.454 405.421 198.335 403.223 197.256 400.985C196.177 398.761 195.152 396.483 194.166 394.179C186.374 375.944 182.484 356.217 182.484 335.011C182.484 313.806 186.374 294.092 194.166 275.844C201.945 257.609 212.601 241.705 226.161 228.158C231.222 223.11 235.858 219.234 239.347 216.503C239.374 216.463 239.414 216.45 239.441 216.437C252.774 217.662 266.121 218.901 279.454 220.126L282.065 237.869L284.715 257.995Z\"></path>     <path fill=\"#C9E8F4\" d=\"M442.903 231.568L399.027 274.232C391.515 265.654 382.524 258.475 372.068 252.707C361.598 246.939 349.117 244.049 334.625 244.049C322.011 244.049 310.276 246.207 299.407 250.496C294.186 252.561 289.284 255.051 284.715 257.995L279.454 220.126L239.44 216.437C249.857 208.285 261.472 201.532 274.259 196.15C292.774 188.371 312.754 184.482 334.226 184.482C357.842 184.482 378.301 188.505 395.604 196.563C412.92 204.609 428.678 216.277 442.903 231.568Z\"></path>     <path fill=\"#318D93\" d=\"M449.75 432.42C420.219 467.838 381.725 485.554 334.226 485.554C312.754 485.554 292.774 481.651 274.259 473.872C255.744 466.093 239.707 455.424 226.16 441.878C216.037 431.768 207.526 420.339 200.639 407.605C200.639 407.605 200.639 407.592 200.626 407.592L220.419 378.221L257.382 383.083C261.179 389.743 265.734 395.724 271.035 401.025C279.081 409.071 288.551 415.251 299.407 419.54C310.276 423.829 322.011 425.974 334.625 425.974C349.93 425.974 363.21 422.897 374.479 416.716C385.747 410.549 395.937 401.691 405.061 390.156L449.75 432.42Z\"></path> </svg></span><span class=\"gb-headline-text\"><strong>PRO TIP</strong></span></p>\n\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-c992ef0f gb-headline-text\"><strong>Tailor your answer to the company\u2019s values.</strong> For example, if they value innovation, mention a past departure due to limited opportunities for new ideas.

Whenever you encounter a problem, tackling it head-on prevents minor issues from escalating into bigger ones that could disrupt the entire workflow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond maintaining smooth operations, your ability to solve problems fosters innovation. It encourages you to think creatively, finding better ways to achieve goals, which keeps the business competitive and pushes the boundaries of what you can achieve.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Effective problem-solving also contributes to a healthier work environment; it reduces stress by providing clear strategies for overcoming obstacles and builds confidence within teams.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Examples of Problem-Solving in the Workplace</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Correcting a mistake at work, whether it was made by you or someone else</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Overcoming a delay at work through problem solving and communication</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Resolving an issue with a difficult or upset customer</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Overcoming issues related to a limited budget, and still delivering good work through the use of creative problem solving</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Overcoming a scheduling/staffing shortage in the department to still deliver excellent work</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Troubleshooting and resolving technical issues</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Handling and resolving a conflict with a coworker</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Solving any problems related to money, customer billing, accounting and bookkeeping, etc.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Taking initiative when another team member overlooked or missed something important</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Taking initiative to meet with your superior to discuss a problem before it became potentially worse</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Solving a safety issue at work or reporting the issue to those who could solve it</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Using problem solving abilities to reduce/eliminate a company expense</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Finding a way to make the company more profitable through new service or product offerings, new pricing ideas, promotion and sale ideas, etc.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Changing how a process, team, or task is organized to make it more efficient</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Using creative thinking to come up with a solution that the company hasn\u2019t used before</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Performing research to collect data and information to find a new solution to a problem</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Boosting a company or team\u2019s performance by improving some aspect of communication among employees</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Finding a new piece of data that can guide a company\u2019s decisions or strategy better in a certain area</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Problem-Solving Examples for Recent Grads/Entry-Level Job Seekers</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Coordinating work between team members in a class project</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Reassigning a missing team member\u2019s work to other group members in a class project</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Adjusting your workflow on a project to accommodate a tight deadline</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Speaking to your professor to get help when you were struggling or unsure about a project</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Asking classmates, peers, or professors for help in an area of struggle</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Talking to your academic advisor to brainstorm solutions to a problem you were facing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Researching solutions to an academic problem online, via Google or other methods</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Using problem solving and creative thinking to obtain an <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/15-most-common-internship-interview-questions-and-answers/\">internship</a> or other work opportunity during school after struggling at first</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How To Answer \u201cTell Us About a Problem You Solved\u201d</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you answer <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-say-in-a-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\">interview questions</a> about problem-solving scenarios, or if you decide to demonstrate your problem-solving skills in a <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/cover-letters-that-get-noticed/\">cover letter</a> (which is a good idea any time the job description mentions problem-solving as a necessary skill), I recommend using the <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/acing-your-next-job-interview-with-the-star-method/\">STAR</a> method.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>STAR stands for:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Situation</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Task</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Action</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Result</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a simple way of walking the listener or reader through the story in a way that will make sense to them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by briefly describing the general situation and the task at hand. After this, describe the course of action you chose and why. Ideally, show that you evaluated all the information you could given the time you had, and made a decision based on logic and fact. Finally, describe the positive result you achieved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>Our sample answers below are structured following the STAR formula.

succinctly?</em></strong></strong></em></strong></em></strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before answering any interview question, it\u2019s important to understand why the interviewer is asking the question in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to questions about your complex problem-solving experiences, for example, the interviewer likely wants to know about your leadership acumen, collaboration abilities, and communication skills, not the problem itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Therefore, your answer should be focused on highlighting how you excelled in each of these areas, not diving into the weeds of the problem itself, which is a common mistake less-experienced interviewees often make.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tailoring Your Answer Based on the Skills Mentioned in the Job Description</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a recruiter, one of the top tips I can give you when responding to the prompt \u201cTell us about a problem you solved,\u201d is to tailor your answer to the specific skills and qualifications outlined in the job description.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve pinpointed the skills and key competencies the employer is seeking, craft your response to highlight experiences where you successfully utilized or developed those particular abilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, if the job requires strong leadership skills, focus on a problem-solving scenario where you took charge and effectively guided a team toward resolution.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By aligning your answer with the desired skills outlined in the job description, you demonstrate your suitability for the role and show the employer that you understand their needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jobsearchamanda/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amanda Augustine</a> expands on this by saying: </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-8bee4dc6\">\n\n<p><strong><em>\u201cShowcase the specific skills you used to solve the problem. Did it require critical thinking, analytical abilities, or strong collaboration? Highlight the relevant skills the employer is seeking.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Interview Answers to \u201cTell Me About a Time You Solved a Problem\u201d</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let\u2019s look at some <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-say-in-a-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\">sample interview answers</a> to, \u201cGive me an example of a time you used logic to solve a problem,\u201d or \u201cTell me about a time you solved a problem,\u201d since you\u2019re likely to hear different versions of this interview question in all sorts of industries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The example interview responses are structured using the STAR method and are categorized into the top 5 key problem-solving skills recruiters look for in a candidate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1.

Show it with specifics. How much did you boost efficiency? Did you save the company money? Adding numbers can really make your achievements stand out.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>To get better at solving problems, analyze the outcomes of past solutions you came up with. You can recognize what works and what doesn\u2019t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about how you can improve researching and analyzing a situation, how you can get better at communicating, and deciding on the right people in the organization to talk to and \u201cpull in\u201d to help you if needed, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, practice staying calm even in stressful situations. Take a few minutes to walk outside if needed. Step away from your phone and computer to clear your head. A work problem is rarely so urgent that you cannot take five minutes to think (with the possible exception of safety problems), and you\u2019ll get better outcomes if you solve problems by acting logically instead of rushing to react in a panic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use all of the ideas above to describe your problem-solving skills when asked interview questions about the topic.

But I\u2019d encourage you to think about whether you have a similar accomplishment from the past one to two years, perhaps in your last job.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hiring managers tend to appreciate recent work experience more than distant experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2</strong>. <strong>Pick a professional achievement even if employers don\u2019t specifically ask for one</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes employers will ask for your greatest professional achievement, and sometimes they\u2019ll leave it open to interpretation and simply say, \u201cWhat is your greatest achievement?\u201d No matter how they phrase the question, keep your answer focused on a professional achievement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is because employers typically favor candidates who can demonstrate success in their professional lives since this suggests a proven track record of industry-relevant accomplishments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By focusing on professional achievements, you showcase your commitment to your career and ability to deliver results that could be beneficial to the potential employer, setting a clear and relevant context for your capabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Example Professional Achievements</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Increased sales or revenue</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improved efficiency or productivity</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Launched or grew a new initiative</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Solved a complex problem</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mentored or trained others</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Exceeded goals or targets</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Received awards or recognition</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Published work or presented at conferences</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>If you have no professional achievements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/find-job-without-work-experience/\">job searching with no work experience</a>, then your academic experience is the closest thing you have. In this case, you should give an example of your greatest achievement from a class project, academic studies, or <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/15-most-common-internship-interview-questions-and-answers/\">internship</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Example Achievements</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Presented research findings at a conference or published a paper in a scholarly journal</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Graduated with honors or received academic awards&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Organized a successful fundraising event</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Held a leadership position in a student organization&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Successfully completed a demanding volunteer project</li>\n\n\n\n<li>First in your family to graduate with a degree</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tips on How to Answer: \u201cWhat Is Your Greatest Achievement?\u201d</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From my time in the industry, I know \u2018What is your greatest achievement?\u2019 can make or break an interview. Here are my best tips for a standout response:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. <strong>Use the STAR Method&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When answering any behavioral <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-say-in-a-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\">interview questions</a> such as this, it\u2019s best to organize your response with the <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/acing-your-next-job-interview-with-the-star-method/\">STAR Method</a>, which is short for Situation, Task, Action, and Result.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a way to structure your answer to ensure hiring managers can follow your story and to make sure you don\u2019t get sidetracked when explaining the achievement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Situation:</strong> You start by explaining the general situation. Were you in a previous job? Which role? How long ago did this happen?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Task:</strong> Explain your specific responsibility or goal within that situation. What were you tasked with achieving?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Action:</strong> Detail the specific initiatives you took to address the challenge.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Result:</strong> Emphasize the positive outcome of your actions. Quantify your impact whenever possible.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s the best way to explain your greatest accomplishments to ensure that you don\u2019t give a long-winded answer that\u2019s too confusing to follow.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-0d80a1ab\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-410965b0\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-1b7c7e01\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-bbec6960\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-bbec6960\">\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-f57fdeb4\"><span class=\"gb-icon\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 666 666\" height=\"1em\" width=\"1em\">     <path fill=\"#115266\" d=\"M333 100.566C461.285 100.566 565.434 204.715 565.434 333C565.434 461.285 461.285 565.434 333 565.434H100.566V333C100.566 204.715 204.715 100.566 333 100.566Z\"></path>     <path fill=\"#66B4DD\" d=\"M405.062 390.156C395.937 401.691 385.748 410.549 374.479 416.716C363.21 422.897 349.93 425.974 334.625 425.974C322.011 425.974 310.276 423.829 299.407 419.54C288.552 415.251 279.081 409.071 271.036 401.025C265.734 395.724 261.179 389.743 257.383 383.083C255.425 379.633 253.666 376.024 252.121 372.241C247.553 361.118 245.275 348.704 245.275 335.011C245.275 321.318 247.553 308.917 252.121 297.782C256.677 286.646 262.99 277.056 271.036 269.011C275.125 264.921 279.574 261.325 284.382 258.208C284.489 258.128 284.609 258.062 284.715 257.995C289.284 255.051 294.186 252.561 299.407 250.496C310.276 246.207 322.011 244.049 334.625 244.049C349.118 244.049 361.598 246.939 372.068 252.707C382.524 258.475 391.515 265.654 399.028 274.232L442.904 231.568C428.678 216.277 412.92 204.609 395.604 196.563C378.302 188.505 357.842 184.482 334.226 184.482C312.754 184.482 292.774 188.371 274.259 196.15C261.472 201.532 249.857 208.285 239.441 216.437C239.414 216.45 239.374 216.463 239.347 216.503C235.858 219.234 231.222 223.11 226.161 228.158C212.601 241.705 201.945 257.609 194.166 275.844C186.374 294.092 182.484 313.819 182.484 335.011C182.484 356.203 186.374 375.944 194.166 394.179C195.152 396.483 196.177 398.761 197.256 400.985C198.335 403.223 199.454 405.421 200.626 407.579L200.64 407.605C207.526 420.339 216.037 431.768 226.161 441.878C239.707 455.424 255.744 466.093 274.259 473.872C292.774 481.651 312.754 485.554 334.226 485.554C381.725 485.554 420.22 467.838 449.75 432.421L405.062 390.156Z\"></path>     <path fill=\"#6AD4DB\" d=\"M284.715 257.995C284.609 258.062 284.489 258.128 284.382 258.208C279.574 261.325 275.125 264.921 271.036 269.011C262.99 277.056 256.677 286.646 252.121 297.782C247.553 308.917 245.275 321.332 245.275 335.011C245.275 348.691 247.553 361.119 252.121 372.241C253.666 376.024 255.425 379.633 257.383 383.07C245.062 381.458 232.741 379.846 220.42 378.221C213.826 388.012 207.233 397.788 200.626 407.579C199.454 405.421 198.335 403.223 197.256 400.985C196.177 398.761 195.152 396.483 194.166 394.179C186.374 375.944 182.484 356.217 182.484 335.011C182.484 313.806 186.374 294.092 194.166 275.844C201.945 257.609 212.601 241.705 226.161 228.158C231.222 223.11 235.858 219.234 239.347 216.503C239.374 216.463 239.414 216.45 239.441 216.437C252.774 217.662 266.121 218.901 279.454 220.126L282.065 237.869L284.715 257.995Z\"></path>     <path fill=\"#C9E8F4\" d=\"M442.903 231.568L399.027 274.232C391.515 265.654 382.524 258.475 372.068 252.707C361.598 246.939 349.117 244.049 334.625 244.049C322.011 244.049 310.276 246.207 299.407 250.496C294.186 252.561 289.284 255.051 284.715 257.995L279.454 220.126L239.44 216.437C249.857 208.285 261.472 201.532 274.259 196.15C292.774 188.371 312.754 184.482 334.226 184.482C357.842 184.482 378.301 188.505 395.604 196.563C412.92 204.609 428.678 216.277 442.903 231.568Z\"></path>     <path fill=\"#318D93\" d=\"M449.75 432.42C420.219 467.838 381.725 485.554 334.226 485.554C312.754 485.554 292.774 481.651 274.259 473.872C255.744 466.093 239.707 455.424 226.16 441.878C216.037 431.768 207.526 420.339 200.639 407.605C200.639 407.605 200.639 407.592 200.626 407.592L220.419 378.221L257.382 383.083C261.179 389.743 265.734 395.724 271.035 401.025C279.081 409.071 288.551 415.251 299.407 419.54C310.276 423.829 322.011 425.974 334.625 425.974C349.93 425.974 363.21 422.897 374.479 416.716C385.747 410.549 395.937 401.691 405.061 390.156L449.75 432.42Z\"></path> </svg></span><span class=\"gb-headline-text\"><strong>PRO TIP</strong></span></p>\n\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-3e3e12f4 gb-headline-text\">When explaining the result, show exactly what you achieved and why it was a significant accomplishment.

gb-headline-text\"><strong><strong><strong><em><strong><em><strong><strong><em>How do I select and frame my greatest achievements for interviews?</em></strong></strong></em></strong></em></strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Before selecting which achievements to share during your interview, review the job posting for clues on how to frame your responses. You want to use the position to shape how you share your accomplishments, not the other way around. If you led a large team in executing a first-of-its-kind digital product launch, the aspects of the accomplishment you focus on will vary depending on whether you\u2019re targeting an individual contributor or management role, digital or physical product position, etc.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. <strong>Be Confident</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-say-in-a-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\">Interview questions</a> that require you to brag <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/tell-me-about-yourself-interview-question-answer/\">about yourself</a> aren\u2019t easy, but you need to be ready to sound <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/show-confidence-interview/\">confident</a> and show off your accomplishment. This isn\u2019t the time to be humble or timid.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When employers ask, \u201cWhat is your greatest professional achievement?\u201d they want you to sound passionate, proud, and <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/show-confidence-interview/\">confident</a>. So think about a great professional achievement that you\u2019d be genuinely excited to talk about. That\u2019s the best way to make sure you have the right level of energy when giving your answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. <strong>Practice Your Answer</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing comes out perfect the first time \u2013 so make sure to practice a few times! Go over the key points you want to share, and make sure you can explain the story clearly and concisely. Aim for 60-90 seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> I don\u2019t recommend memorizing word-for-word. That\u2019s a good way to panic in the interview, forget a piece, and make a mistake. Instead, I\u2019d think of your story as a series of key points to talk about (the <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/acing-your-next-job-interview-with-the-star-method/\">STAR</a> method is useful here) and make sure you can remember to hit each point and transition smoothly between them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>\u201cTell Me Your Proudest Accomplishment or Greatest Achievement\u201d Example Answers</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have a general idea of what to do when you answer these questions about your proudest accomplishments/achievements, let\u2019s look at some example answers for different industries:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tech </h3>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-92e87b74\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-e2f7ae6c\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-1bb05177\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-1bb05177 box-shadow\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-b30efb93\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"556\" height=\"192\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='556'%20height='192'%20viewBox='0%200%20556%20192'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82801 perfmatters-lazy\" style=\"width:197px\" data-src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.png\" data-srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.png 556w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4-300x104.png 300w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"556\" height=\"192\" src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82801\" style=\"width:197px\" srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.png 556w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4-300x104.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\" /></noscript></a></figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><em>\u201cIn my previous role as a </em><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/software-developer/\"><em>software developer</em></a><em> at Nexxus Technologies, our team was tasked with developing a new feature for our flagship product.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>My responsibility was to lead the backend development and ensure seamless integration with existing systems.

It can catch you off your guard because it may seem vague, broad, and somewhat tricky. Honestly though, understanding a bit more about why interviewers ask this question (which is often framed as a command) will give you a clear insight into how to answer.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interviewers ask this question to ease you out of those introductory jitters (that you both feel) and into the nitty-gritty of why you\u2019re there. It\u2019s their way of establishing a direction for the interview because it shows them how you summarize your experience and show its relevance to the job you\u2019re applying for, which in turn tells them what to ask next. Trust me though, your answer needs to be relevant, the interviewer is likely not asking whether you\u2019re a dog or a cat person but rather what background, skills, qualifications and experiences brought you to this interview today.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Watch: How to Answer \u201cTell Me About Yourself?\u201d</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"mv-video-target mv-video-id-kuckuerrcupiilaboikq\" data-video-id=\"kuckuerrcupiilaboikq\" data-volume=\"70\" data-ratio=\"16:9\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Different Ways of Asking the Same Question</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I mentioned how this question can sometimes be framed as a command, i.e: \u201ctell me about yourself,\u201d and so on. There are numerous ways this question might be framed, but all express the same intention on the part of the interviewer, so they should all be answered the same way. Common variants include:</span></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTake me through your resume.\u201d</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cTell me about your background\u201d</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cDescribe yourself.\u201d</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cCan you tell me more about why you\u2019re here?\u201d</span></li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhat brings you here today?\u201d</span></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to describing yourself, you may wonder where to start, how personal to be, and how far to get into it. \u201cDescribe yourself\u201d certainly feels a little more personal than the rest. For insight into how to answer that variant, Read </span><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/describe-yourself-interview-question/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Article</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Answer \u201cTell Me About Yourself\u201d in an Interview:</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Choose the Right Starting Point for Your Story (IMPORTANT)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your goal when answering, \u201ctell me about yourself,\u201d is to give a brief, concise walkthrough of your career story that will show off relevant pieces of experience.&nbsp;You want to start at a point in the past (like how you began working in this field), and end up in your current situation. So the first thing to decide is where you\u2019ll begin the story\u2026<strong>If you\u2019re a recent graduate: Start with the fact that you just graduated, and explain <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/why-did-you-choose-this-career-best-answer/\">why you chose this career</a> path or field of area of study.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, you might start your answer like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cI graduated with my <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/top-15-economics-degree-jobs/\">degree in Economics</a> two months ago. I chose that field of study because I\u2019ve always been interested in finance and money, and a couple of family members told me it leads to great career options, too.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>If you have 1-8 years of experience, start with the moment you graduated and walk them through your employment experience since then.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of how you\u2019d start your interview answer in this situation:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cI graduated with my <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/top-15-industrial-engineering-degree-jobs/\">degree in Industrial Engineering</a> six years ago and immediately went to work for a small design firm in Chicago. Since then, I\u2019ve\u2026\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And if you have 8-20+ years of experience, you can start with a mid-point in your career. This will keep your answer from getting too long.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re a manager, you could start with how you first became a manager. If you\u2019ve been working for 25 years but have only been a <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/a-career-in-sales-everything-you-need-to-know/\">sales professional</a> for 12 years, you could begin with how you got started in sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here is an example of how to begin your answer to \u201ctell me about yourself\u201d as a very experienced candidate:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cI first started managing people twelve years ago, when I was promoted from Customer Service Associate to Customer Service Supervisor. Since then, I\u2019ve\u2026\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Highlight Impressive Experience and Accomplishments</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As you tell your career story, explain key accomplishments you\u2019ve achieved, work you\u2019ve done, skills you\u2019ve learned, and key career moves you\u2019ve made.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Were you promoted? That\u2019s always a great sign and worth mentioning.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Did you accomplish something significant like solving a big problem for your last employer?&nbsp; That\u2019s great to mention, too.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Did you build new skills or overcome challenges? Get specific! Tell details.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But random impressive facts aren\u2019t enough. You should be thinking about how this ties in with the company you\u2019re talking to.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>You should always <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/research-company-before-job-interview/\">research the company before going into the interview</a>. Study their job description in particular so you know what skills THEY care most about.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What does this particular job involve? Is there a lot of leadership? Talk about your experiences leading (no matter how small!), how it went, and what you learned.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Does the job involve a high level of technical skill? Talk about how you learned and advanced in that area through each step of your career!</li>\n\n\n\n<li>You need to \u201ctailor\u201d your answer for, \u201ctell me about yourself,\u201d for their job description and their needs. Try to talk about experiences and qualifications that are relevant to this job you\u2019ve applied for.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Conclude by Explaining Your Current Situation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the best way to finish your story is to bring them up to speed on your current situation. <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/why-did-you-apply-for-this-position/\">Why you wanted to apply for their job</a>, what you\u2019re looking to do next, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For example you might end your answer by saying:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201c\u2026and that\u2019s why I wanted to interview with your firm. This position seems like a great opportunity to advance those skills I just talked about, and continue building my career and challenging myself\u201d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Keep Your Answer Work-Related</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When employers ask, \u201ctell me about yourself,\u201d in an interview, they usually want to hear about you as a professional. So the safest approach is to keep your answer work-related and share your career story, rather than personal details. You can show more personality as the interview goes on, but it\u2019s risky to share too much personal info when answering, \u201ctell me about yourself.\u201d It could lead to your answer getting too long, or it could cause you to leave out important professional information that the interviewer was looking to know!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Be Concise When Answering (2 Minutes or Less!)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When they say \u201ctell me about yourself,\u201d it\u2019s going to be tempting to give a long-winded answer. It\u2019s such an open-ended question. <strong>And we covered a lot above, but there\u2019s something just as important as any of that. You need to be concise.&nbsp;</strong>Your communication and ability to stay on track with your answer are two things they are watching closely. The interviewer wants to see that you can tell your story from Point A (the beginning) to Point B (the end) without getting sidetracked, distracted, or scattered. Because it tells them how you\u2019ll communicate as an employee\u2026 when there\u2019s a problem, when there\u2019s a disagreement, or when you simply need to share your knowledge or opinion. <strong>If you take this answer beyond 2 minutes you are shooting yourself in the foot.</strong> In fact, below 90 seconds is ideal. Practice at home with a timer! That\u2019s why I recommend choosing a starting point based on your experience (Step 1 above)\u2026 because if you have 25 years of experience and you start at the moment you graduated from college, your answer will be too long.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u201cTell Me About Yourself\u201d Example Answers:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve covered the key steps to answering, \u201ctell me about yourself,\u201d let\u2019s look at some full answer examples to this <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-say-in-a-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\">interview question</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Example Answer for Experienced Candidates:</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cI graduated with a <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/top-15-business-degree-jobs/\">Business degree</a> in 2010, and was offered an account management position at a telecommunications company I had interned with. I loved working with customers and managing and growing my accounts, but the industry we were in just wasn\u2019t very appealing to me. After that, I stayed a full year and learned a ton about how to build and manage accounts successfully and&nbsp; I ended up becoming a top performer in my group before leaving. I left at the 1-year-mark to pursue a very similar position within an industry I\u2019m much more excited about- healthcare. I\u2019ve been at this healthcare startup space for 2 years with this company and I feel ready to take my career to the next level so that\u2019s why I\u2019m currently looking for a new opportunity.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>That first example showed you how to answer \u201ctell me about yourself\u201d for experienced job seekers (at least a few years of experience). Now let\u2019s look at an example for entry-level job seekers and <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/find-job-without-work-experience/\">job seekers with no experience</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Example Answer With No Experience:</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cI graduated with a degree in Engineering two months ago. I chose that field of study because I\u2019ve always been interested in math and <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/top-17-physics-degree-jobs/\">physics</a>, and a couple of family members told me it leads to great career options. One of my key accomplishments during my academic career was speaking at a conference on the topic of energy-efficient window design, based on research I had done for one of my senior-level classes. This led to an <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/15-most-common-internship-interview-questions-and-answers/\">internship</a> that I just wrapped up, so I\u2019m actively looking for a full-time position now.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Stand Out by \u201cTailoring\u201d Your Answer to the Company</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The end of your interview answer is a big opportunity to customize your answer for the company and job you\u2019re interviewing for. When you talk about what you\u2019re looking to do next in your career, try to mention whatever you see this company providing for your career (leadership, technical challenges, exposure to new areas, etc.) That shows them why you\u2019re excited about their job, which will help you get hired! (I explain more about why this is true <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/why-did-you-apply-for-this-position/\">here</a>). Before we move on to more tips and a HUGE mistake to avoid, here\u2019s one more example interview answer for this question.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Shorter Method for How to Answer \u201cTell Me About Yourself\u201d (For Experienced Candidates Only)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The method I gave you above is the standard way most recruiters recommend answering \u201ctell me about yourself.\u201d&nbsp; It\u2019s how I coached job seekers to answer this question for years. There\u2019s another way you can answer, though\u2026 and it has some benefits. I\u2019ll explain\u2026Many experts have pointed out that if the interviewer wanted your career story, they could have looked at <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-put-on-resume/\">your resume</a> or <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/best-linkedin-profile-tips/\">your LinkedIn</a>, or asked a question like, \u201ccan you walk me through your background?\u201d So there\u2019s another approach for answering, \u201ctell me about yourself,\u201d that skips the career story and just cuts right to the chase: Why you\u2019re awesome and <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/interview-question-why-should-we-hire-you/\">why they should hire you</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let\u2019s look at 2 word-for-word templates that accomplish this. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this, you\u2019ll have two proven methods for answering, \u201ctell me about yourself\u201d in interviews, and in the next section, I\u2019ll reveal how to decide which method is best for YOU.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Example answer if you\u2019re job searching while employed:</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m currently working at XYZ Company and I specialize in doing ___. The reason I applied for this job is I saw ___ on the job description and I think I would be able to help you ___ and ___. One of my key accomplishments in my current role was helping my employer do ___, and I\u2019m confident I can help your team get similar results here.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Example answer template if unemployed:</h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>\u201cIn my most recent position at XYZ Company, I specialized in doing ___. The reason I applied for this job is I saw ___ on the job description and I think I would be able to help you ___ and ___. One of my key accomplishments in my last role for XYZ Company was helping them&nbsp; ___, and I\u2019m confident I can help your team get similar results here.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Which Method Should You Use for Your Answer?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have work experience, both options we\u2019ve covered are very good, and it really depends on what you feel most comfortable with. Choose the one you like best. They\u2019re both excellent ways to answer the question, so don\u2019t stress over it! However, if you are entry-level and have no work experience\u2026 or internships at the very least\u2026&nbsp; then I would go back to the top of this article and use the first, 5-step method for answering, \u201ctell me about yourself.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This second method we just covered is really best if you want to give a unique, concise answer and you have some relevant work experience to share in the interview!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">\u201cTell Me About Yourself\u201d Example Answers For Different Industries:</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Healthcare:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cAfter being licensed six years ago, I immediately entered a busy E.R. setting where I progressed to the point of triaging as many as 50 patients a shift. I\u2019m skilled in patient record-keeping, stabilizing incoming patients, diagnosing injuries, administering meds, doing stitches, starting I.V.s, setting bones and offering emotional support to family members behind the scenes. I\u2019ve adapted to the pressure but feel that, in the long term, I\u2019d be better suited to a slower-paced environment with more focus on establishing lasting patient relationships. I\u2019m ready to take on this post in your busy day clinic and believe that my advanced patient triage skills, along with my empathic nature, would be a great benefit to your team.\u201d</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>This works because:</strong>&nbsp; </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This answer outlines your qualifications and extensive background in incoming patient care, triage, diagnosing and record-keeping. Your honesty about long term goals is appreciated. The answer shows how your skills have progressed since you were licensed, and it inspires confidence in your ability to handle a hands-on post at a busy clinic.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Service Industry:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cHaving spent eight years in the food and beverage industry, I progressed from head waiter to front of house manager four years ago. I\u2019ve held so many posts in the industry, from runner to waiter to head waiter to manager, but my dedication to quality service has never changed. I believe in knowing my product and process inside and out, uplifting my team members and demonstrating focused positivity throughout. It\u2019s easy to fall into the temper trap when things get busy, but I prefer to knuckle down, smile and get it done. I want my customers to come back for more!\u201d</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>This works because: </strong></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This answer makes an impact because of how your personality shines through. The service industry is incredibly stressful, but it\u2019s refreshing to know that you have a proactive, positive attitude to stressful situations, backed up with strong product knowledge and professionalism.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Tech</strong>:</span></h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019m an accredited software engineer and systems integrator with more than ten years of active development experience. I\u2019m proficient in Ruby, Python, Java, C++ and a wide range of associated languages and frameworks. I\u2019m a team player, and I love bouncing ideas off my colleagues and engaging with diverse perspectives. I like to stay abreast of the latest tech and I\u2019m wildly competitive when it comes to troubleshooting. I\u2019ve also got an eye for detail and clean design and I\u2019m dedicated to delivering a seamless, streamlined experience to the end-user.\u201d</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>This works because: </strong></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From this answer, it\u2019s clear that you\u2019re accredited and boast a diversified programming portfolio with plenty of experience in the field. It\u2019s noted that you\u2019re a team player, as teamwork is essential when developing and managing systems for a busy tech enterprise. And your attitude to <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/problem-solving-examples/\">problem solving</a>, as being competitive will help you find fast and effective solutions.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Retail:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow\">\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cI\u2019ve been a <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/15-most-common-retail-interview-questions-and-answers/\">retail</a> cosmetic artist and sales assistant for six years and I\u2019m passionate about making clients feel utterly gorgeous! I have a strong knowledge of retail processes, including stock-take, merchandising and sales targeting. If I have to describe my stand-out quality it\u2019s that I love to build up the team, make my colleagues smile and get them motivated to break targets for our department. Above all though, the customer comes first and I\u2019m dedicated to building brand and store loyalty in the customer.\u201d</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>This works because: </strong></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From this answer, it\u2019s obvious you know retail like the back of your hand and that you take pride in breaking targets and boosting the team morale. Your positivity shines through, and you highlight your passion for making clients feel special.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Practice Your Answer Before the Interview</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a final tip \u2013 make sure you go practice everything you plan on saying when the interviewer asks, \u201cwhat can you tell me about yourself?\u201d Nothing comes out perfect the first time, and you don\u2019t want to appear nervous and stumble when they ask.&nbsp; So I\u2019d recommend grabbing a piece of paper and writing down the key points you want to talk about in your answer. I like to write them in bullet format. Then, use your smartphone\u2019s voice recorder app to record a few practice answers and see how you sound. Don\u2019t look at your notes as you give your answer. The idea is to try to remember what you want to talk about without reading off the paper. Then glance at the paper AFTER to make sure you covered everything. Keep practicing until you can give a smooth answer without forgetting anything important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note: If you\u2019re <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/phone-interview-questions-best-answers/\">having&nbsp;a phone interview</a>, you can use notes/bullet points to help guide you through your answer. Nobody can see you on the phone, so take advantage!</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-5db80e85\">\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-base-2-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-base-2-background-color has-background\">\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-0ec43197\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-2e6a8c4d\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-7b1c6b54\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-7b1c6b54\">\n<figure class=\"gb-block-image gb-block-image-8796466a\"><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/author/biron/\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='150'%20height='150'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Biron Clark\" class=\"avatar avatar-150 wp-user-avatar wp-user-avatar-150 alignnone photo gb-image-8796466a perfmatters-lazy\" data-src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Biron-Clark-uai-158x158.png\" data-srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Biron-Clark-uai-336x336.png 2x\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Biron-Clark-uai-158x158.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Biron-Clark-uai-336x336.png 2x\" alt=\"Biron Clark\" class=\"avatar avatar-150 wp-user-avatar wp-user-avatar-150 alignnone photo gb-image-8796466a\" /></noscript></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-6d502a65\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-6d502a65\">\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-aefdd19e gb-headline-text\"><strong>About the Author</strong></p>\n\n\n<div style=\"font-size:16px;\" class=\"wp-block-post-author-biography\">Biron Clark is a former executive recruiter who has worked individually with hundreds of job seekers, reviewed thousands of resumes and LinkedIn profiles, and recruited for top venture-backed startups and Fortune 500 companies.

style=\"height:35px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Becoming an SEO specialist requires a unique blend of analytical skills, creativity, and a keen understanding of how the digital world operates. This role is not just about understanding keywords or links; it\u2019s about comprehensively understanding digital marketing and how search engines work to connect users with the content they seek. Let\u2019s dive into the educational requirements and skill set you\u2019ll need to cultivate to thrive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Education</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do I Need a Degree to Become an SEO Specialist?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A college degree is not strictly necessary to become an SEO specialist.</strong> This field places a significant emphasis on practical skills, such as digital marketing acumen, proficiency in <a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/blog/keyword-research/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">keyword research</a>, and the ability to perform web analytics effectively. These competencies are often viewed as more critical than formal education credentials, as they are the top requirements in any <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/hiring-an-seo-specialist-job-description-template/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SEO specialist job description</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, employers are primarily interested in candidates who can demonstrate a solid track record of successful SEO strategies and projects. They value proven experience and tangible results that showcase an individual\u2019s ability to improve website visibility, increase organic traffic, and contribute to overall business growth through SEO efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As such, you should focus on building practical experience, whether through internships, freelance projects, or personal ventures. Additionally, staying abreast of the latest trends and algorithm updates in search engine optimization and continuously honing one\u2019s skills through online courses, workshops, and industry certifications can significantly enhance employability in this field.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To sum it up, while a college <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/top-15-marketing-degree-jobs/\">degree in marketing</a>, communications, information technology, or related areas can provide a useful foundation and may be beneficial for certain aspects of digital marketing, it is not a prerequisite for becoming an SEO Specialist. Practical skills, experience, and a demonstrated ability to deliver effective SEO strategies are the keys to success in this career path.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are the Key Requirements for Becoming an SEO Specialist?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike many traditional careers, the path to becoming an SEO Specialist isn\u2019t paved with rigid educational requirements or a one-size-fits-all approach. Instead, it thrives on a foundation of diverse skills, continuous learning, and real-world experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are the key requirements that can set you on the path to success in the SEO space:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>A Solid Understanding of SEO Fundamentals</strong>: Before diving into the deep end, it\u2019s crucial to grasp the basics of SEO, including how search engines work, the importance of keywords, and the difference between <a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/blog/on-page-vs-off-page-seo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">on-page and off-page SEO</a> techniques. This foundational knowledge serves as the backbone of your SEO career.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Technical Proficiency</strong>: A successful SEO Specialist understands the technical aspects of websites, such as site structure, mobile optimization, and the significance of page speed. Familiarity with HTML and CSS can also enhance your ability to diagnose and address SEO issues.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Analytical and Strategic Thinking</strong>: The ability to analyze data from tools like Google Analytics and make informed decisions is paramount. An SEO Specialist must look at the numbers, interpret what they mean, and devise strategies that align with business goals.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Content Creation and Marketing Skills</strong>: Content is king in the world of SEO. Knowing how to create content that\u2019s not only engaging but also optimized for search engines is a critical skill. This involves understanding user intent, conducting keyword research, and crafting content that resonates with your target audience.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Link Building Expertise</strong>: Understanding the importance of backlinks and having strategies to earn these links is essential. This requires networking, relationship building, and creativity to secure quality links that boost a site\u2019s authority and ranking.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Adaptability and Continuous Learning</strong>: SEO is an industry characterized by rapid changes and updates. Staying informed about the latest algorithm updates, trends, and best practices through blogs, forums, webinars, and conferences is non-negotiable for anyone looking to thrive in this field.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Practical Experience</strong>: Theory is important, but nothing beats hands-on experience. Start your own projects, contribute to forums, or take on <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/best-freelance-websites-for-finding-online-jobs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">freelance work</a> to apply what you\u2019ve learned and demonstrate your ability to improve website rankings and traffic.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can I Become an SEO Specialist through Online Education?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>answer is a resounding yes</strong>, mirroring the diversity of this career. Online education platforms, industry blogs, webinars, and specialized courses offer a wealth of knowledge to begin an online SEO education. According to GotchSEO, many professionals enter the field via on-the-job experience or by leveraging online training courses, underscoring the practical nature of SEO skills over formal academic credentials. Similarly, TealHQ emphasizes the importance of self-education through online resources and hands-on practice, suggesting that creating your own projects can serve as a crucial learning experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, SEO certifications, which can significantly bolster one\u2019s credentials, are widely available through online platforms. SEMrush lists top <a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/blog/seo-certification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SEO certifications</a> that are both free and paid, suggesting that these certifications can come from educational platforms, digital marketing agencies, or other SEO-related businesses. Likewise, it is advisable to take courses in computer applications, <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/top-15-web-design-degree-jobs/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">web design</a>, and similar topics, highlighting the technical competencies required in the field, which can also be cultivated online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Becoming an SEO Specialist through online education is not only possible but encouraged. The field values practical skills, continuous learning, and adaptability, all of which can be developed through the wealth of resources available online. Whether through formal courses, certifications, or self-directed projects, online education offers a flexible and accessible route to mastering SEO.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What are Some Web Resources to Learn Skills to Become an SEO Specialist?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are some authoritative websites tailored to learning SEO skills:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://moz.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Moz</a>: </strong>Offers comprehensive resources, guides, and tools for beginners and advanced SEO professionals.

Meanwhile, medium-sized companies may be more susceptible to hiring a No Experience Recruiter without a degree\u2014allowing candidates with a related background and adaptable skills to excel in the role.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking these points into account, it\u2019s possible to break into the industry without a degree; however, advancing within the field will likely require one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why is it Important to Get a Degree as a Recruiter?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Getting a degree can be important for a recruiter for several reasons, including:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Enhanced Knowledge Base</strong>: A degree, especially in fields like human resources, psychology, or business, provides foundational knowledge that can be directly applicable to recruitment processes, such as understanding organizational behavior, employment law, and effective communication strategies.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Credibility with Clients and Candidates</strong>: Having a degree can increase a recruiter\u2019s credibility. It signals a commitment to the profession and can make clients and candidates more confident in the recruiter\u2019s abilities.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Competitive Edge</strong>: In a competitive job market, having a degree can set a recruiter apart from others who do not have similar educational backgrounds. This can be particularly important when applying for positions in large organizations or highly specialized industries.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Professional Development</strong>: The process of earning a degree often helps develop critical skills such as problem-solving, time management, and analytical thinking, which are valuable in any career but particularly in recruitment where evaluating candidates and managing multiple hiring processes is key.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Networking Opportunities</strong>: College or university programs offer opportunities to meet professionals in the field, whether through internships, alumni networks, or professional associations. These connections can be invaluable as a recruiter seeks to expand their network of candidates and clients.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Access to Resources</strong>: Higher education institutions often provide access to the latest research, tools, and technologies related to human resources and recruitment. This can keep a recruiter at the forefront of best practices and industry trends.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Career Advancement</strong>: Holding a degree can be a prerequisite for advancement into senior roles within many organizations, and ultimately earning a more attractive recruiter salary. It may also open up opportunities for a broader range of positions within the human resources field.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How Long Does it Take to Get a Human Resources Management Degree?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s an overview of what to expect in terms of duration and requirements for obtaining a Human Resources <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/top-15-management-degree-jobs/\">Management degree</a>:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Duration for Full-time Students: </strong>Typically, a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Human Resource Management can be completed in three to four years if pursued full-time.

These skills encompass both technical expertise and interpersonal abilities. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are some key skills you can expect to learn and develop as a recruiter:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Sourcing and Talent Acquisition</strong>: Recruiters need to be skilled in sourcing and attracting top talent.

This can lead to long hours and the necessity of being available outside of traditional work hours to communicate with candidates who may have their own work during the day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/news/talent-acquisition/recruiter-top-10-list-jobs-offer-work-life-balance\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">report by SHRM</a>, talent acquisition specialists rank highly in terms of<strong> work/life balance satisfaction, with a rating of 4.0 out of 5</strong>, indicating that despite the pressures, many recruiters find ways to maintain a satisfactory balance between their professional and personal lives. This satisfaction can stem from the flexibility often found in recruiting roles, where the outcomes\u2014filling a position with the right candidate\u2014are more critical than adhering to a strict schedule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the work-life balance can differ markedly between agency recruiters and internal recruiters. Agency recruiters may experience more variability in their workload, as it can be tied closely to the fluctuating demands of their clients. This can sometimes result in periods of intense work followed by slower periods. On the other hand, internal recruiters may have a more steady workload but still face pressure to fill positions quickly to avoid operational disruptions within their organization.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the role of a recruiter is inherently demanding, many professionals in this field successfully manage to achieve a good work-life balance. The satisfaction derived from matching the right candidate with the right job, along with the flexibility often afforded by the profession, contributes to this balance. However, <strong>the extent to which a recruiter enjoys work-life harmony can depend greatly on their specific employment context and their personal strategies for managing stress and workload</strong>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-55874a87\">\n\n<h2 class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-2d761329\"><span class=\"gb-icon\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" role=\"img\" height=\"1em\" width=\"1em\" viewBox=\"0 0 256 512\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M224.3 273l-136 136c-9.4 9.4-24.6 9.4-33.9 0l-22.6-22.6c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9l96.4-96.4-96.4-96.4c-9.4-9.4-9.4-24.6 0-33.9L54.3 103c9.4-9.4 24.6-9.4 33.9 0l136 136c9.5 9.4 9.5 24.6.1 34z\"></path></svg></span><span class=\"gb-headline-text\">What\u2019s the Career Outlook for a Recruiter?</span></h2>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>The career outlook for recruiters is notably positive, reflecting a growing demand for skilled professionals in this field over the next decade.

The question of whether a degree is necessary to become a product manager is a nuanced one. Here, we will provide insights and more clarity into this topic, reflecting a blend of opinions and industry practices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://producthq.org/career/product-manager/product-manager-education-requirements/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ProductHQ</a>, a <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/top-15-business-degree-jobs/\">degree in business</a>, computer science, economics, marketing, statistics, public relations, or even design could give an edge. <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/advisor/education/business-and-marketing/become-a-product-manager/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Forbes</a> echoes this sentiment by emphasizing that a Bachelor of Science in marketing or a degree in business can furnish students with a foundational understanding of several disciplines relevant to product management.

Also, being mentally present and limiting work-related thoughts to work hours is a strategy some product managers use to manage their work-life balance, as shared by <a href=\"https://balancethegrind.co/work-life-balance/how-product-managers-view-work-life-balance/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">eight Product Managers on Balance the Grind</a>.

only sharing how they\u2019re qualified for a role without highlighting what sets them apart from other candidates.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019ve made it to the interview stage, it\u2019s evident that you\u2019re qualified, and now it\u2019s your time to showcase how you\u2019re distinct from the other applicants. Importantly, though, you want to back up your claims with examples and results. Anyone can make a claim, but you\u2019ll be a more memorable interviewee if you back it up with a powerful story.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>When answering this interview question, it\u2019s best to give detailed, specific examples. Notice how in the sample answers above, narrow and precise skills were named. The bottom line is:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You want to avoid general claims like, \u201cI\u2019m a hard worker\u201d and instead be more specific.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why does this matter? Every job seeker claims to be a hard worker. They make many general claims like that. Hiring managers are tired of hearing that every candidate is a hard worker.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, a general, non-specific answer doesn\u2019t paint a clear picture in the hiring manager\u2019s mind of how you\u2019ll help them if you\u2019re hired for the position. Give more specific examples to show why you\u2019re truly the best candidate and how you can contribute to the organization.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Example: </strong>Instead of saying, \u201cI\u2019m very organized\u201d and \u201dI\u2019m a hard worker,\u201d (which is not unique at all) you could say:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-484335b4\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-aa0f86b1\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-f342c079\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-f342c079 box-shadow\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-0df73c22\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"556\" height=\"192\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='556'%20height='192'%20viewBox='0%200%20556%20192'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82801 perfmatters-lazy\" style=\"width:197px\" data-src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.png\" data-srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.png 556w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4-300x104.png 300w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"556\" height=\"192\" src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82801\" style=\"width:197px\" srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4.png 556w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-4-300x104.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\" /></noscript></a></figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>\u201cOne thing that makes me unique is my organizational skills.

    "Recruiter\u2019s Guide to Perfect Thank You Emails After Interviews": "<div class=\"inside-article\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\n<p>Imagine leaving your interview, feeling a mix of relief and excitement after a great conversation with the hiring manager. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there\u2019s one more step to solidify that positive impression: the thank-you note. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often overlooked, this simple gesture could set you apart in a crowded field of candidates.&nbsp;In this article, I\u2019m going to share exactly what to do (and NOT do) when thanking the employer, based on my experience as a <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/careers/recruiter/\">recruiter</a>.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-23ee4ae9\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-d35f5dca\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-aee72f4c\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-aee72f4c\">\n\n<h3 class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-b44e51eb gb-headline-text\"><strong>Highlights</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"has-small-font-size wp-block-list\">\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Send your thank-you email within 24 hours of the interview to keep your interaction fresh in the interviewer\u2019s mind.</li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Customize your thank you note after the interview to reflect specific aspects of the conversation to demonstrate attentiveness and interest.</li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Keep the email concise, aiming for a length of 85 to 150 words to convey professionalism and respect for the recipient\u2019s time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Follow up politely if you don\u2019t receive a response within a week, to show persistence without appearing pushy.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Is It Important To Write a Thank You Email After an Interview?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The post-interview thank you email is something you should get in the habit of sending, no matter what the anticipated outcome is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing so shows the interviewer that you appreciated their time, and just as importantly, that you\u2019re still interested in the position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After attending an interview, the employer isn\u2019t sure that you still want this job (just like you\u2019re not sure if the <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/signs-interview-went-badly/\">interview went well</a> and they want to hire you).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\u2019s important to write a thank you message to reaffirm your interest and tell them that you\u2019re eager to hear about the next steps.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-37ad1fc6\">\n<div class=\"gb-container

<em>the</em> determining factor that secures you a job offer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, when executed well, the thank-you note is a fantastic opportunity to further demonstrate your communication skills and follow-through abilities, as well as reinforce that you\u2019re the right choice for the role. It\u2019s also the perfect method for highlighting any points you may have forgotten to mention during the interview or wanted to further clarify.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>When To Send a Thank You Email or Letter After an Interview</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Aim to send your post-interview thank you email the day after your job interview, between 12pm and 3pm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your interview was on a Friday, send your email the same day. (This is to avoid sending your email on a weekend).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Always make sure the email is sent within 24 hours of your interview so your conversation is still fresh in the interviewer\u2019s mind.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you decide to send your thank you note as a letter in the mail, you should post it within one or two <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-are-business-days-everything-you-need-to-know/\">business days</a> of your job interview.

If you\u2019re in a very traditional industry (like wedding planning) or if you\u2019re interviewing for a high-level position (like <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/ceo-vs-cfo-differences-in-roles-responsibilities-salaries/\">CFO</a>, Head of Operations, etc.).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A letter can add a degree of traditional elegance and personalization that emails don\u2019t have. Still, in most industries and scenarios, a thank you email would be the way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>One more option to consider: </strong>You could write a personalized thank you card and then send a picture of it digitally, either in a LinkedIn message or an email. That\u2019s a good way to stand out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common Mistakes I\u2019ve Seen Candidates Make in Thank You Emails</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While a thank you interview email is fairly simple to write, there\u2019s still room for error. Some of the most common mistakes that candidates commit when contacting recruiters this way include:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Not Customizing the Email</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the best thank you email templates or examples appear low-effort (and will NOT impress the interviewer) if you don\u2019t customize them. So how can you customize the email? Here are some ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>First, you could mention something interesting you learned about the job or company from the recruiter. What caught your attention and sounded exciting about the position?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You could reference one or two of their <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-say-in-a-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\">interview questions and answers</a> you gave in response. For example, you could say:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>\u201cI really enjoyed your question about ___ and the discussion it led to. It was also great learning about how XYZ company does ___\u201d.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Or you could mention something personal they discussed with you! Maybe the interviewer told you they\u2019re watching their son at a big basketball tournament that evening. You could say:</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>\u201cBy the way, I hope your son\u2019s team did great at the basketball tournament. How did things turn out?\u201d</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>As another example, maybe you mentioned that you love coffee, and the interviewer said, \u201cOh, then you HAVE to try Corner House Coffee. Best coffee in town.\u201d You could write:</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>\u201cBy the way, I tried a latte from Corner House Coffee on the way home, and you were absolutely right. It was the best coffee I\u2019ve had in a long time.\u201d</strong></em></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-35473e4f\">\n\n<p><strong>A cookie-cutter thank-you note just isn\u2019t enough. Make sure to mention something specific from your conversation to demonstrate your attentiveness and involvement. And if you met with multiple people, take a moment to send a personalized thank-you note to each panel member!</strong></p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><strong>The bottom line is</strong>: The more you customize your email after the interview, the more hiring managers will appreciate it. You\u2019ll notice that each sample email above includes space for customization, and this is why.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Failing to Proofread</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A typo is an eyesore. It also suggests sloppiness. Not taking the time to proofread your thank you note, even if you commit a tiny mistake, will raise a red flag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Email templates are only as good as the effort you put into filling them out and proofreading them. Go over every detail and make sure it actually makes sense for your situation. If not, sending that thank you email or letter will do more harm than good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example: In the third sample email earlier in this article, it says, \u201cThank you for taking the time to meet with me.\u201d If you had a phone interview, you should say, \u201cThank you for taking the time to talk on the phone with me.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Appearing Too Pushy or Unprofessional&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sounding too pushy or aggressive will be an immediate turnoff for a recruiter. Keep your thank you note meaningful but lighthearted. An optimistic, friendly tone will get you noticed for the right reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sending multiple follow-up emails is also a big no-no as it enters the pushy territory once again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, try to make your note genuine.

Then I\u2019ll share word-for-word sample answers you can take inspiration from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three key things employers look for in every answer to this question, so let\u2019s start with that\u2026</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-d35f5dca\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-aee72f4c\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-aee72f4c\">\n\n<h5 class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-b44e51eb gb-headline-text\"><strong>Highlights</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"has-small-font-size wp-block-list\">\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Pick a manageable situation where you can demonstrate your strengths and resilience, not a major disaster.</li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Structure your answer using <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/acing-your-next-job-interview-with-the-star-method/\">STAR</a>: Provide context (Situation), explain your task (Task), detail your actions (Action), and emphasize the outcome and learnings (Result).</li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Highlight what you learned from a past mistake or setback, showcasing your ability to adapt and improve.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Do Interviewers Ask About a Time You Failed?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are three key traits that employers are looking for when they ask this interview question, and your answer needs to address all three areas if you want to \u201cwow\u201d the hiring manager or <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/careers-recruiter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recruiter</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. <strong>Show That You\u2019re Accountable</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Employers don\u2019t want to hire someone who makes excuses and always blames others for their mistakes. This type of person doesn\u2019t usually learn from their failures and is difficult to work with overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, when the employer asks about a time you failed or <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/interview-question-mistakes-you-made/\">made a mistake</a>, show them you take responsibility for mistakes instead of putting the blame on others. Own up to it, acknowledge that you could have done something better/differently, and be clear and direct when explaining.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. <strong>Assess Your Resilience and Growth Mindset</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone makes mistakes, but no hiring manager wants to hire somebody who\u2019s going to keep repeating the same errors over and over again. Interviewers want to see how you handle setbacks. Do you crumble under pressure, or do you bounce back and learn from the experience?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So make sure you show them what you learned from the experience and how you used it to grow and improve.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-8bee4dc6\">\n\n<p>Instead of worrying about your failures, concentrate on how you overcame them. Share stories that highlight your creativity in finding solutions, your determination in tough situations, and the valuable insights you gained along the way.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:5px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. <strong>Evaluate Your Communication Skills</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Any time the interviewer asks a question that requires a story (which definitely includes a question like, \u201cTell me about a time when you failed\u201d), they\u2019re looking to see whether you can tell a clear story and get from point A to point B without getting sidetracked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you can\u2019t communicate clearly in a job interview, the interviewer will be concerned about your future communication skills on the job. So don\u2019t let your <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-say-in-a-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">interview answers</a> ramble on for four minutes or go in a bunch of different directions. Keep it brief.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong>How to Answer \u201cTell Me About a Time When You Failed\u201d</strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. <strong>Choose a Suitable Failure</strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Interviewers are not looking to punish you when they ask you this question. Instead, focus on finding a situation that showcases your strengths. Ideally, it should be relevant to the job you\u2019re applying for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pick an experience where you used a skill important to the position, but where things didn\u2019t go exactly according to plan. The key here is to demonstrate that it was a manageable setback, not a major collapse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about mistakes that didn\u2019t have severe financial or personal repercussions. Think of these mistakes as miscalculations, not failures. Miscalculations are common in the workplace. They\u2019re everyday occurrences, and people learn a lot from them that they can apply in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-2c42a023-7fff-8842-39fb-a0898da4044a\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-alternates: normal; font-variant-position: normal; vertical-align: baseline;\">Perhaps you were tasked with leading a team project that didn\u2019t meet the initial deadline. Or maybe you presented a complex idea to a client and their feedback revealed a misunderstanding. </span></span></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. <strong>Structure Your Response using the STAR Method</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From years of evaluating candidate responses, I\u2019ve seen firsthand how well-thought-out and structured answers make a lasting impression. The <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/acing-your-next-job-interview-with-the-star-method/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">STAR method</a> provides a clear and compelling framework to tell your story:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Situation:</strong> Briefly describe the context of the situation. What project were you working on? What was your role?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Task:</strong> Explain what you were responsible for in this scenario. What were you trying to achieve?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Action: </strong>Detail the steps you took and the approach you used to tackle the task.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Result: </strong>Be honest about the outcome. Did things go as planned? Didn\u2019t they quite meet expectations? What did you learn from this experience?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. <strong><strong>Emphasize Learning and Growth</strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After you have spoken about the outcome and why things didn\u2019t go to plan, you should take the opportunity to explain what you learned from the experience and how you would approach a similar situation differently in the future. This is where you can demonstrate your ability to learn from mistakes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you finish telling the interviewer about a time you failed\u2026 don\u2019t just talk about what you learned from it\u2026 show them a real example. It\u2019s one thing to say you learned a lot from a failure, but an example or story is more powerful in demonstrating that you truly improved.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:5px\"

    "How to Answer \u201cWhat is Your Desired Salary?\u201d": "<div class=\"inside-article\">\n\t\t\n\t\t<div class=\"entry-content\">\n\t\t\t\n<p>Having witnessed the importance of effectively answering \u201cWhat is your desired salary?\u201d in job applications and interviews, I\u2019ll share the best strategies with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s start with the most important rule: The best tip on how to answer \u201cWhat is your desired salary?\u201d on applications and interviews is to <strong>AVOID</strong> telling the company your specific salary expectations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, you want to wait until you know the company is interested in offering you the position to reveal your salary expectations. Sharing your desired salary before this point can cost you thousands of dollars or cost you the job, and I\u2019ll explain why in this article.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-d35f5dca\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-aee72f4c\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-aee72f4c\">\n\n<h5 class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-b44e51eb gb-headline-text\"><strong>Highlights</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"has-small-font-size wp-block-list\">\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Do not disclose your desired salary early in the application process. This can hurt your negotiation leverage later on.</li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">The overall goal is to delay salary discussions until the employer expresses interest in hiring you. This strengthens your negotiation position and allows you to secure a more competitive offer.</li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">When pressed about salary, consider discussing your most recent salary or redirecting the question back to the interviewer.</li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Negotiate salary after receiving a job offer. Research market value for similar positions to inform your desired salary range. Be prepared to counter the initial offer with data to support your request.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div></div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Is a Desired Salary?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Commonly requested by interviewers and hiring managers, a desired salary is the amount you wish to earn from a new job. Of course, your desired salary should be realistic and align with your skills, experience, and current market trends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance, depending on the area, a realistic salary for an entry-level <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/15-most-common-accountant-interview-questions-and-answers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">accountant</a> might be $50,000 \u2014 requesting a salary of $175,000 would likely result in a few raised eyebrows.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong>When Is the Best Time To Discuss a Desired Salary?</strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The best time to discuss your desired salary is after the employer has expressed interest in you and ideally after you\u2019ve had a chance to learn more about the specific role and responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There are a few reasons for this:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Stronger Negotiation Position:</strong> Once the company has invested time interviewing you and sees you as a potential fit, they\u2019ll be more willing to negotiate to secure your talent.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Informed Discussion:</strong> By this point in the interview process, you\u2019ll have a better understanding of the role\u2019s requirements and what the company is looking for. This allows you to tailor your salary expectations to the specific position.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Avoiding Early Disqualification:</strong> If you disclose a desired salary that\u2019s outside the company\u2019s budget early on, it could take you out of the running before you have a chance to showcase your skills and experience.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong><strong>How to Determine Your Desired Salary</strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Having spent years on the other side of the table,<strong> </strong>I\u2019ve seen countless candidates struggle with the question, \u201cWhat is your desired salary?\u201d But here\u2019s the good news: with some research and self-assessment, you can confidently approach the salary conversation knowing your worth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Market Research</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to provide a desired salary within an acceptable range, you should start your research by learning more about the company and the open position. Glassdoor is an excellent resource for salary averages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several factors can also influence salary ranges, including company size, industry, geographic location, and the level of demand for the role.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/staff-accountant-salary-SRCH_KO0,16.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">according to Glassdoor</a>, a Staff <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/15-most-common-accountant-interview-questions-and-answers/\">Accountant</a> in New York City should expect base pay of <strong>$55,606</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong>Assess Your Skills and Experience</strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When considering your desired salary, it\u2019s important to take stock of your value in the job market. This includes your formal qualifications like education and certifications, but also your relevant work experience and accomplishments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more specialized your skills and the more successful you\u2019ve been in previous roles, the higher your value will be to potential employers, and therefore, the higher your desired salary range can be.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong>Personal Needs</strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Salary expectations can also vary depending on where you live. Cities with a high cost of living will typically offer higher salaries to compensate for expenses like housing and transportation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about your desired lifestyle as well. Do you need a salary that allows for a luxurious lifestyle, or are you more flexible with your living standards? Understanding your cost of living will help you determine a salary that allows you to live comfortably.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong>Consider Benefits</strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, you\u2019ll also want to consider the company\u2019s benefits package. You might not be able to get your requested salary, but if the organization offers robust health insurance or a great retirement plan, you should factor it into your decision.</p>\n\n\n<div

effectively without underselling myself or pricing myself out?</strong></em></strong></strong></em></strong></em></strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Market research and available salary data should lead your negotiation, as companies base their offers on the going rate for people with similar backgrounds, experiences, and skills. As you calculate your pay, don\u2019t forget to consider the total compensation beyond your base salary, which might include a sign-on and/or performance bonus, stock options, health insurance, and other forms of remuneration, all of which can add tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, in additional value to your package.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong>How to Answer \u201cWhat is Your Desired Salary?\u201d</strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Candidates often felt pressured to give a number right away, unsure of what was fair or how to negotiate effectively. The good news is, with a little preparation, you can transform this conversation into an opportunity to showcase your value.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s my best advice:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong><strong>Focus on Value</strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t just throw out a number. Instead, emphasize the value you bring to the company. Briefly showcase your relevant skills and experience, highlighting how you can address their specific needs. This reframes the conversation from what you want to what you\u2019re worth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, <strong>you\u2019re selling yourself</strong>, so focus on the value you offer and showcase your willingness to find a win-win solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong><strong>Highlight Flexibility</strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Salary negotiations are a two-way street. Signal your willingness to work with the company by expressing openness to discussing the total compensation package. This includes benefits like health insurance, paid time off, and retirement contributions, as well as potential for growth and bonuses.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By demonstrating that you value a well-rounded offer, you open the door to a more creative and mutually beneficial agreement.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong><strong>State a Desired Range</strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If pressed, or if you believe that you must provide a figure to proceed to the next stage in the hiring process, you can state a broad range rather than a specific desired salary. This shows you\u2019ve done your research and establishes some wiggle room for negotiation. Make sure the range is realistic based on your experience and the market value for similar positions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is preferable because you\u2019re less likely to rule yourself out and get eliminated by going too high, and you\u2019re less likely to limit your job offer later by going too low.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-d87174ff\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-3707d953\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-936929cf\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-54888dc3\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-54888dc3\">\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-f873d2c8\"><span class=\"gb-icon\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 666 666\" height=\"1em\" width=\"1em\">     <path fill=\"#115266\" d=\"M333 100.566C461.285 100.566 565.434 204.715 565.434 333C565.434 461.285 461.285 565.434 333 565.434H100.566V333C100.566 204.715 204.715 100.566 333 100.566Z\"></path>     <path fill=\"#66B4DD\" d=\"M405.062 390.156C395.937 401.691 385.748 410.549 374.479 416.716C363.21 422.897 349.93 425.974 334.625 425.974C322.011 425.974 310.276 423.829 299.407 419.54C288.552 415.251 279.081 409.071 271.036 401.025C265.734 395.724 261.179 389.743 257.383 383.083C255.425 379.633 253.666 376.024 252.121 372.241C247.553 361.118 245.275 348.704 245.275 335.011C245.275 321.318 247.553 308.917 252.121 297.782C256.677 286.646 262.99 277.056 271.036 269.011C275.125 264.921 279.574 261.325 284.382 258.208C284.489 258.128 284.609 258.062 284.715 257.995C289.284 255.051 294.186 252.561 299.407 250.496C310.276 246.207 322.011 244.049 334.625 244.049C349.118 244.049 361.598 246.939 372.068 252.707C382.524 258.475 391.515 265.654 399.028 274.232L442.904 231.568C428.678 216.277 412.92 204.609 395.604 196.563C378.302 188.505 357.842 184.482 334.226 184.482C312.754 184.482 292.774 188.371 274.259 196.15C261.472 201.532 249.857 208.285 239.441 216.437C239.414 216.45 239.374 216.463 239.347 216.503C235.858 219.234 231.222 223.11 226.161 228.158C212.601 241.705 201.945 257.609 194.166 275.844C186.374 294.092 182.484 313.819 182.484 335.011C182.484 356.203 186.374 375.944 194.166 394.179C195.152 396.483 196.177 398.761 197.256 400.985C198.335 403.223 199.454 405.421 200.626 407.579L200.64 407.605C207.526 420.339 216.037 431.768 226.161 441.878C239.707 455.424 255.744 466.093 274.259 473.872C292.774 481.651 312.754 485.554 334.226 485.554C381.725 485.554 420.22 467.838 449.75 432.421L405.062 390.156Z\"></path>     <path fill=\"#6AD4DB\" d=\"M284.715 257.995C284.609 258.062 284.489 258.128 284.382 258.208C279.574 261.325 275.125 264.921 271.036 269.011C262.99 277.056 256.677 286.646 252.121 297.782C247.553 308.917 245.275 321.332 245.275 335.011C245.275 348.691 247.553 361.119 252.121 372.241C253.666 376.024 255.425 379.633 257.383 383.07C245.062 381.458 232.741 379.846 220.42 378.221C213.826 388.012 207.233 397.788 200.626 407.579C199.454 405.421 198.335 403.223 197.256 400.985C196.177 398.761 195.152 396.483 194.166 394.179C186.374 375.944 182.484 356.217 182.484 335.011C182.484 313.806 186.374 294.092 194.166 275.844C201.945 257.609 212.601 241.705 226.161 228.158C231.222 223.11 235.858 219.234 239.347 216.503C239.374 216.463 239.414 216.45 239.441 216.437C252.774 217.662 266.121 218.901 279.454 220.126L282.065 237.869L284.715 257.995Z\"></path>     <path fill=\"#C9E8F4\" d=\"M442.903 231.568L399.027 274.232C391.515 265.654 382.524 258.475 372.068 252.707C361.598 246.939 349.117 244.049 334.625 244.049C322.011 244.049 310.276 246.207 299.407 250.496C294.186 252.561 289.284 255.051 284.715 257.995L279.454 220.126L239.44 216.437C249.857 208.285 261.472 201.532 274.259 196.15C292.774 188.371 312.754 184.482 334.226 184.482C357.842 184.482 378.301 188.505 395.604 196.563C412.92 204.609 428.678 216.277 442.903 231.568Z\"></path>     <path fill=\"#318D93\" d=\"M449.75 432.42C420.219 467.838 381.725 485.554 334.226 485.554C312.754 485.554 292.774 481.651 274.259 473.872C255.744 466.093 239.707 455.424 226.16 441.878C216.037 431.768 207.526 420.339 200.639 407.605C200.639 407.605 200.639 407.592 200.626 407.592L220.419 378.221L257.382 383.083C261.179 389.743 265.734 395.724 271.035 401.025C279.081 409.071 288.551 415.251 299.407 419.54C310.276 423.829 322.011 425.974 334.625 425.974C349.93 425.974 363.21 422.897 374.479 416.716C385.747 410.549 395.937 401.691 405.061 390.156L449.75 432.42Z\"></path> </svg></span><span class=\"gb-headline-text\"><strong>PRO TIP</strong></span></p>\n\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-c992ef0f gb-headline-text\">To avoid early salary discussions, bypass the preliminary screening by leveraging your network. If you know someone in the organization, ask them to forward your resume to the hiring manager. Focus on selling yourself in the role initially. A strong impression will put you in a better position to negotiate a fair salary later.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to Answer \u201cWhat is Your Desired Salary?\u201d (With Examples)</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, I\u2019ve seen responses that have both impressed and left me confused. The truth is, the best approach to answering \u201cWhat is your desired salary?\u201d can vary depending on where you are in the hiring process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this section, I\u2019ll provide tactics and specific examples of well-crafted responses you can use to confidently answer the salary question at different stages of the hiring process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong><strong><strong>Job Application</strong></strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to answer desired salary or salary expectations on a job application is to leave the field blank or write \u2018Negotiable\u2019 rather than providing a number.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the application does not accept non-numerical text, then enter \u201c999,\u201d or \u201c000\u201d. Then, look for a notes section later in the job application and write, \u201cRegarding desired salary, this is negotiable and can be discussed in the interview.\u201d It is not beneficial in any way for you to write your desired salary on job applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s why\u2026</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you say a number that\u2019s too high, you could scare them off immediately. And if you provide a desired salary that\u2019s too low, it can cripple your ability to negotiate later.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong><strong><strong>Initial Job Interview</strong></strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>During the initial interview, the employer might be gauging general salary expectations.

This way, you can counter the offer with an informed target salary, and if the employer balks at this number, you have the data to back it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A good strategy is to not provide a specific number but a range. For instance, if you\u2019re seeking a desired salary of $50K, you can ask for a salary between $48K and $54K. That way, the hiring manager will be more inclined to settle for a number at the lower end of your range, feeling like they got a good bargain for your expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, when communicating your salary range, remain professional and confident. After all, thorough research helped you determine your desired salary. And if the company can\u2019t meet your reasonable expectations, you can likely find another that will.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:20px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong>The Goal: Save Salary Discussion Until You Know They Want To Offer You The Job</strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember the main goal of everything we\u2019ve covered above\u2026 whether you\u2019re deciding what to put for desired salary on an application, or preparing to face the topic in your interview.&nbsp; Before you know the company wants to hire you, you have no leverage to negotiate with or make demands with.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when employers ask about your desired salary on applications and interviews, the best thing to do is to delay the discussion until they want to offer you the position.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Refocus the conversation on your skills and the job responsibilities to determine whether it\u2019s a good potential match.

impression?</em></strong></em></strong></strong></em></strong></em></strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Recruiters and hiring managers are often juggling dozens of interviews and business meetings per week, so it can be difficult to craft answers that stand out in their memories, but it\u2019s possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key is to relay a personal story or anecdote as to why you\u2019re drawn to the company. If you personally use the product or service, don\u2019t be afraid to share a story of how it\u2019s improved your life. At the same time, you don\u2019t need to go into a monologue. Less is often more when storytelling.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<div style=\"height:5px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong><strong>How Do You Know What You Are Passionate About?</strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re thinking \u201cWhat am I passionate about\u201d, or if you\u2019re still not sure which one thing to mention in your interview answer, then this section is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best way to decide which passion to name is to look at the job/industry and work backward by thinking about what excites you and interests you in that job. Ask yourself, \u201cWhat are the main characteristics of this job that appeal to me?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could be: Working with technology, solving interesting technical challenges, helping people, making a difference in people\u2019s lives, helping people live healthier lives, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then think about why that excites you, or how that fits into your personal interests. By approaching the question like this, you\u2019ll always have an answer that relates to the job you\u2019re interviewing for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, if you have a different passion that you want to mention, that\u2019s fine, too. I\u2019m not suggesting you lie or be fake in the interview.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I am suggesting that if you go to an interview for a Nursing job, and you say that your passion is playing online video games, they\u2019re going to wonder about how hard you\u2019re going to work.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-fff14bb8\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-01a9f0bf\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-f3135b23\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-b3241255\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-b3241255\">\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-d79b56f9\"><span class=\"gb-icon\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 666 666\" height=\"1em\" width=\"1em\">     <path fill=\"#115266\" d=\"M333 100.566C461.285 100.566 565.434 204.715 565.434 333C565.434 461.285 461.285 565.434 333 565.434H100.566V333C100.566 204.715 204.715 100.566 333 100.566Z\"></path>     <path fill=\"#66B4DD\" d=\"M405.062 390.156C395.937 401.691 385.748 410.549 374.479 416.716C363.21 422.897 349.93 425.974 334.625 425.974C322.011 425.974 310.276 423.829 299.407 419.54C288.552 415.251 279.081 409.071 271.036 401.025C265.734 395.724 261.179 389.743 257.383 383.083C255.425 379.633 253.666 376.024 252.121 372.241C247.553 361.118 245.275 348.704 245.275 335.011C245.275 321.318 247.553 308.917 252.121 297.782C256.677 286.646 262.99 277.056 271.036 269.011C275.125 264.921 279.574 261.325 284.382 258.208C284.489 258.128 284.609 258.062 284.715 257.995C289.284 255.051 294.186 252.561 299.407 250.496C310.276 246.207 322.011 244.049 334.625 244.049C349.118 244.049 361.598 246.939 372.068 252.707C382.524 258.475 391.515 265.654 399.028 274.232L442.904 231.568C428.678 216.277 412.92 204.609 395.604 196.563C378.302 188.505 357.842 184.482 334.226 184.482C312.754 184.482 292.774 188.371 274.259 196.15C261.472 201.532 249.857 208.285 239.441 216.437C239.414 216.45 239.374 216.463 239.347 216.503C235.858 219.234 231.222 223.11 226.161 228.158C212.601 241.705 201.945 257.609 194.166 275.844C186.374 294.092 182.484 313.819 182.484 335.011C182.484 356.203 186.374 375.944 194.166 394.179C195.152 396.483 196.177 398.761 197.256 400.985C198.335 403.223 199.454 405.421 200.626 407.579L200.64 407.605C207.526 420.339 216.037 431.768 226.161 441.878C239.707 455.424 255.744 466.093 274.259 473.872C292.774 481.651 312.754 485.554 334.226 485.554C381.725 485.554 420.22 467.838 449.75 432.421L405.062 390.156Z\"></path>     <path fill=\"#6AD4DB\" d=\"M284.715 257.995C284.609 258.062 284.489 258.128 284.382 258.208C279.574 261.325 275.125 264.921 271.036 269.011C262.99 277.056 256.677 286.646 252.121 297.782C247.553 308.917 245.275 321.332 245.275 335.011C245.275 348.691 247.553 361.119 252.121 372.241C253.666 376.024 255.425 379.633 257.383 383.07C245.062 381.458 232.741 379.846 220.42 378.221C213.826 388.012 207.233 397.788 200.626 407.579C199.454 405.421 198.335 403.223 197.256 400.985C196.177 398.761 195.152 396.483 194.166 394.179C186.374 375.944 182.484 356.217 182.484 335.011C182.484 313.806 186.374 294.092 194.166 275.844C201.945 257.609 212.601 241.705 226.161 228.158C231.222 223.11 235.858 219.234 239.347 216.503C239.374 216.463 239.414 216.45 239.441 216.437C252.774 217.662 266.121 218.901 279.454 220.126L282.065 237.869L284.715 257.995Z\"></path>     <path fill=\"#C9E8F4\" d=\"M442.903 231.568L399.027 274.232C391.515 265.654 382.524 258.475 372.068 252.707C361.598 246.939 349.117 244.049 334.625 244.049C322.011 244.049 310.276 246.207 299.407 250.496C294.186 252.561 289.284 255.051 284.715 257.995L279.454 220.126L239.44 216.437C249.857 208.285 261.472 201.532 274.259 196.15C292.774 188.371 312.754 184.482 334.226 184.482C357.842 184.482 378.301 188.505 395.604 196.563C412.92 204.609 428.678 216.277 442.903 231.568Z\"></path>     <path fill=\"#318D93\" d=\"M449.75 432.42C420.219 467.838 381.725 485.554 334.226 485.554C312.754 485.554 292.774 481.651 274.259 473.872C255.744 466.093 239.707 455.424 226.16 441.878C216.037 431.768 207.526 420.339 200.639 407.605C200.639 407.605 200.639 407.592 200.626 407.592L220.419 378.221L257.382 383.083C261.179 389.743 265.734 395.724 271.035 401.025C279.081 409.071 288.551 415.251 299.407 419.54C310.276 423.829 322.011 425.974 334.625 425.974C349.93 425.974 363.21 422.897 374.479 416.716C385.747 410.549 395.937 401.691 405.061 390.156L449.75 432.42Z\"></path> </svg></span><span class=\"gb-headline-text\"><strong>PRO TIP</strong></span></p>\n\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-d386192d gb-headline-text\">Determine the skills and values that fuel your enthusiasm, like assisting others, being innovative, or enhancing efficiency.

So my best advice is to name one area of interest. Don\u2019t say you\u2019re passionate about \u201ceverything\u201d or give a generic answer. Talk about something you truly care about and provide specific details.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. <strong><strong>Relate Your Passion to the Job</strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, your passion can connect to the job you\u2019re applying for. Discuss how your interests align with the company\u2019s mission, values, or the responsibilities of the position.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a nursing candidate. You can say you\u2019re passionate about helping others. You\u2019ve always been someone who\u2019s looked after others and wanted to help people. Then you\u2019d go on to explain how nursing seemed like the perfect career, given this passion of yours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you\u2019re explaining your passion while also explaining <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/why-did-you-choose-this-career-best-answer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">why you chose this career</a>. In fact, preparing to answer an interview question like \u201cWhat are you passionate about?\u201d is going to also give you some great ideas you can share in response to many other <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-say-in-a-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">commonly-asked interview questions</a> like:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/why-did-you-apply-for-this-position/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Why did you apply for this job?</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/interview-questions-why-do-you-want-this-job-best-answer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Why do you want this job?</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-motivates-you/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">What motivates you?</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. <strong>Highlight Transferable Skills</strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Reflect on the skills you\u2019ve developed through your passion that are applicable to the job you\u2019re interviewing for. This helps demonstrate how your passion relates to the position and showcases your ability to contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, \u201cI\u2019m really passionate about building robots for robotics competitions. This has been a fantastic way to develop my problem-solving and critical-thinking skills. We often encounter unexpected challenges during construction, forcing us to think creatively and find quick solutions. The competitions also require a strong understanding of engineering principles, which I believe would be valuable in this <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/hiring-a-software-engineer-job-description-template/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">software engineering</a> role.\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/bill-burnett-4225401/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bill Burnett</a>, Co-Director of Stanford d.school</strong></strong></strong> <strong>says</strong>:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-25e8ac9a\">\n\n<p>\u201cTailor your answer to the interview.

As we\u2019ve mentioned, make sure to connect your passions to your skills and the role/company\u2019s mission or values.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Failing to do so can make it seem like you\u2019re not genuinely interested in the position or that you haven\u2019t done your research.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li class=\"has-medium-font-size\"><strong>Lying or Exaggerating</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s easy for hiring managers to see through a fake answer. They\u2019ve likely heard it all before, and inauthenticity can raise red flags about your fit for the <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-is-company-culture-how-to-improve-yours/\">company culture</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if your true passion isn\u2019t directly related to the role, focus on transferable skills or interests that demonstrate your drive and align with the company\u2019s values.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>Final Advice</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you choose a work-related passion or a personal passion, it\u2019s best to name one single thing that you\u2019re passionate about, and then explain why. Don\u2019t pick anything that will sound like a distraction that will take away from your ability to work (for example, I don\u2019t recommend saying, \u201cI\u2019m very passionate about playing video games.\u201d) And make sure to give a truthful answer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hiring managers ask this interview question because they want to get to know you and learn a bit about you, and they\u2019re pretty good at sensing when you\u2019re giving a \u201ccanned\u201d answer that you read online but isn\u2019t true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these tips are covered in more detail in the article above, so if you skipped down to the conclusion, I\u2019d recommend scrolling back up and reading step-by-step on how to handle this job interview question. If you follow these tips, you\u2019ll have a great response when you hear an interview question like, \u201cWhat are you passionate about?\u201d.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-33d7847d\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-e6adffce\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-34cbb528\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-34cbb528\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-5db80e85\">\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-base-2-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-base-2-background-color has-background\">\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-0ec43197\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-2e6a8c4d\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-7b1c6b54\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-7b1c6b54\">\n\n<figure class=\"gb-block-image gb-block-image-8796466a\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"503\" height=\"496\" class=\"gb-image gb-image-8796466a perfmatters-lazy\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='503'%20height='496'%20viewBox='0%200%20503%20496'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"picture of Biron Clark\" title=\"Biron-Clark-meet-team\" data-src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1.png 503w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1-300x296.png 300w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"503\" height=\"496\" class=\"gb-image gb-image-8796466a\" src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1.png\" alt=\"picture of Biron Clark\" title=\"Biron-Clark-meet-team\" srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1.png 503w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1-300x296.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\" /></noscript></figure>\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-6d502a65\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-6d502a65\">\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-aefdd19e gb-headline-text\"><strong>About the Author</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-2630df48 gb-headline-text\">Biron Clark is a former executive recruiter who has worked individually with hundreds of job seekers, reviewed thousands of resumes and LinkedIn profiles, and recruited for top venture-backed startups and Fortune 500 companies.

After all, you\u2019ve probably touched on all the ins and outs of your work history, education, and skills. You\u2019ve likely answered behavioral and situational <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-say-in-a-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">interview questions</a>; what\u2019s left to know about you?</p>\n<div class=\"mv-ad-box\" data-slotid=\"content_btf\" style=\"height: 250px; width: max(300px, 100%); overflow: clip !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-frame-250\" data-slotid=\"content_btf\" style=\"overflow: visible !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-slide-250\" data-slotid=\"content_btf\" style=\"overflow: visible !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-sticky-250\" data-slotid=\"content_btf\"><div id=\"content_btf_wrapper\" class=\"adunitwrapper content_btf_wrapper\" data-wrapper=\"content_btf\" data-nosnippet=\"\">\n          <div id=\"content_btf\" class=\"content_btf adunit\">\n            \n          </div>\n        </div><mv-ad-reporter data-slot-id=\"content_btf\" data-offering=\"1\" data-offering-name=\"mediavine\" data-offering-domain=\"mediavine.com\"></mv-ad-reporter></div></div></div>\n  \n        \n    \n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p>From my experience, the primary reason interviewers will commonly ask this question is to give you a chance to talk about additional qualifications, achievements, or experiences that are not on your resume and that didn\u2019t naturally come up over the course of the interview.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also a great way to get an insight into your personality, values, work ethic, and interpersonal skills.

While it\u2019s more than acceptable to talk about unique aspects of your life in interviews, at least in most industries, it\u2019s also important that you connect the dots between your answer and the company and position for which you\u2019re interviewing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you played years of Division I sports during college, for instance, that might be okay to share during an interview, but you also want to explain how you apply those teamwork and collaboration skills in the workplace today.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. <strong>Ask a Question About the

So let\u2019s cover those now!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. <strong>Thinking You Need To Add Something</strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>From my experience as a <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/careers-recruiter/\">recruiter</a>, many candidates slip up on this question by thinking they need to tell the interviewer something more about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You do not need to add anything here. You can use example answer #1 from earlier in the article to simply say that you\u2019re satisfied with what you already shared and are really interested in the role. This is better than starting to answer without really knowing what you\u2019ll say, or without having a purpose or plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. <strong>Trying to Clarify Too Much</strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you try to go back and clarify five different areas or skills that you feel you didn\u2019t explain well, then it\u2019s just going to overwhelm the interviewer and make it so that none of your points are convincing or helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So pick your battles and choose one, maybe two things to add. That\u2019s the absolute maximum to aim for when answering, \u201cIs there anything else you\u2019d like us to know about you?\u201d</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. <strong>Sharing Irrelevant Information</strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p data-slot-rendered-content=\"true\">This question is your chance to clarify any information or highlight unique qualities or experiences that were not covered in the interview. The interviewer doesn\u2019t want to listen to you talk about your hobbies that are totally unrelated to the job or your entire life story.</p>\n<div class=\"mv-ad-box\" data-slotid=\"content_6_btf\" style=\"height: 250px; width: max(300px, 100%); overflow: clip !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-frame-250\" data-slotid=\"content_6_btf\" style=\"overflow: visible !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-slide-250\" data-slotid=\"content_6_btf\" style=\"overflow: visible !important;\"><div class=\"mv-rail-sticky-250\" data-slotid=\"content_6_btf\"><div id=\"content_6_btf_wrapper\" class=\"adunitwrapper content_btf_wrapper\" data-wrapper=\"content_6_btf\" data-nosnippet=\"\">\n          <div id=\"content_6_btf\" class=\"content_btf adunit\">\n            \n          </div>\n        </div><mv-ad-reporter data-slot-id=\"content_6_btf\" data-offering=\"1\" data-offering-name=\"mediavine\" data-offering-domain=\"mediavine.com\"></mv-ad-reporter></div></div></div>\n  \n        \n    \n</div>\n\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong><strong>Final Advice</strong></strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, this interview question is a great opportunity to address a previous answer that you weren\u2019t happy with, or add new information that you feel will help you land the job. This will ensure that the employer sees the full extent of your skills and abilities so you can get more <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/how-to-write-a-job-offer-letter-template-examples/\">job offers</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you already made a great case for why your skills are a fit for this opportunity, and you\u2019re satisfied with what you\u2019ve said, then there\u2019s no need to add more here. In this case, when they ask, \u201cIs there anything else you would like me to know about you?\u201d you can tell the interviewer that you feel you\u2019ve covered the important points and that you\u2019re satisfied with how you shared your experience and skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then, you can ask a question like, \u201cWhat are the next steps in the process?\u201d or \u201cWhat happens next?\u201d These are good, confident phrases to end your interview while also finding out what to expect moving forward. If you follow these steps, you\u2019ll have an impressive response that boosts your chances of winning the job offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want more help getting ready for your next interview, then this article is the next thing you should read:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-to-say-in-a-job-interview-questions-and-answers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sample answers to the 20 most common job interview questions.</a></p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-f0e2ad4f alignwide\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-fb3729ac\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-cb6a640a\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-cb6a640a\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-a263e112\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-b86029ef\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-0986fbfb\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-0986fbfb\">\n\n<figure class=\"gb-block-image gb-block-image-83b8007b\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"503\" height=\"496\" class=\"gb-image gb-image-83b8007b perfmatters-lazy\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='503'%20height='496'%20viewBox='0%200%20503%20496'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"picture of Biron Clark\" title=\"Biron-Clark\" data-src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1.png 503w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1-300x296.png 300w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"503\" height=\"496\" class=\"gb-image gb-image-83b8007b\" src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1.png\" alt=\"picture of Biron Clark\" title=\"Biron-Clark\" srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1.png 503w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1-300x296.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\" /></noscript></figure>\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-e9f9390b\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-e9f9390b\">\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-6873b4a8 gb-headline-text\"><strong>About the Author</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-dae7d8b0 gb-headline-text\"><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/author/biron/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://careersidekick.com/author/biron/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Biron Clark</a>, a former executive recruiter, has advised job seekers since 2012, helping them land competitive positions.

They\u2019re basically assessing how much you can contribute to their success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s a real chance to highlight specific talents, achievements, or qualities that set you apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. <strong>Test Your Initiative and Research</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Hiring managers want to hire someone who is <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/research-company-before-job-interview/\">researching employers</a> and taking their time when applying and looking for the <em>right</em> fit, not just the first job they can find.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They don\u2019t want to hire someone who is just applying to hundreds of positions without thinking about whether the job is a good fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So your answer should always show that you\u2019ve taken time to research and understand their role and organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.jobsearchamanda.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Amanda Augustine</a>, Career Expert, CPCC &amp; CPRW</strong>, <strong>emphasizes the importance of this approach:</strong></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-85f78f53\">\n\n<p>\u201cThis question allows employers to see if you\u2019ve researched their company, its mission, and its goals. It\u2019s also a chance for them to gauge your enthusiasm for the role and how you see yourself fitting in.\u201d</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Now that you know why employers ask this interview question, let\u2019s look at how to answer it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to Answer \u201cWhat Can You Bring to This Company?\u201d</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who has conducted countless interviews, I\u2019ve found that candidates who clearly articulate their value proposition and fit within the company leave a lasting impression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are my top tips to craft the perfect response:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. <strong>Research the Company</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Dive deep into the company\u2019s website, <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/social-media-influencer/\">social media</a> platforms, and recent news articles. This will help you understand their mission, values, recent projects, and any challenges they might be facing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By tailoring your response to align with what the company values or needs, you can demonstrate a genuine interest and the potential to be a good fit for the role and the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. <strong>Identify Your Skills and Strengths</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Be sure to review the job description to identify the key skills and experience the company is seeking. This allows you to connect your own skills and experiences directly to the specific needs of the role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s best to name specific job-related skills, not <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/soft-skills-to-succeed/\">soft skills</a>. This isn\u2019t the time to say, <em>\u201cI\u2019m hard-working, I\u2019m detail-oriented, I have excellent problem-solving abilities\u2026\u201d</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, it\u2019s better to say: <em>\u201cI\u2019ve spent the past four years working on </em><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/graphic-designer-2/\"><em>graphic design</em></a><em> and branding projects. This directly aligns with the main focus of this role. </em><em>In my previous position, I wasn\u2019t just creating designs, but I was also working within the same industry you operate in. This means I can hit the ground running and contribute immediately, without needing extra time to learn the industry specifics.\u201d</em></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-d87174ff\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-3707d953\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-936929cf\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-54888dc3\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-54888dc3\">\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-f873d2c8\"><span class=\"gb-icon\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" fill=\"none\" viewBox=\"0 0 666 666\" height=\"1em\" width=\"1em\">     <path fill=\"#115266\" d=\"M333 100.566C461.285 100.566 565.434 204.715 565.434 333C565.434 461.285 461.285 565.434 333 565.434H100.566V333C100.566 204.715 204.715 100.566 333 100.566Z\"></path>     <path fill=\"#66B4DD\" d=\"M405.062 390.156C395.937 401.691 385.748 410.549 374.479 416.716C363.21 422.897 349.93 425.974 334.625 425.974C322.011 425.974 310.276 423.829 299.407 419.54C288.552 415.251 279.081 409.071 271.036 401.025C265.734 395.724 261.179 389.743 257.383 383.083C255.425 379.633 253.666 376.024 252.121 372.241C247.553 361.118 245.275 348.704 245.275 335.011C245.275 321.318 247.553 308.917 252.121 297.782C256.677 286.646 262.99 277.056 271.036 269.011C275.125 264.921 279.574 261.325 284.382 258.208C284.489 258.128 284.609 258.062 284.715 257.995C289.284 255.051 294.186 252.561 299.407 250.496C310.276 246.207 322.011 244.049 334.625 244.049C349.118 244.049 361.598 246.939 372.068 252.707C382.524 258.475 391.515 265.654 399.028 274.232L442.904 231.568C428.678 216.277 412.92 204.609 395.604 196.563C378.302 188.505 357.842 184.482 334.226 184.482C312.754 184.482 292.774 188.371 274.259 196.15C261.472 201.532 249.857 208.285 239.441 216.437C239.414 216.45 239.374 216.463 239.347 216.503C235.858 219.234 231.222 223.11 226.161 228.158C212.601 241.705 201.945 257.609 194.166 275.844C186.374 294.092 182.484 313.819 182.484 335.011C182.484 356.203 186.374 375.944 194.166 394.179C195.152 396.483 196.177 398.761 197.256 400.985C198.335 403.223 199.454 405.421 200.626 407.579L200.64 407.605C207.526 420.339 216.037 431.768 226.161 441.878C239.707 455.424 255.744 466.093 274.259 473.872C292.774 481.651 312.754 485.554 334.226 485.554C381.725 485.554 420.22 467.838 449.75 432.421L405.062 390.156Z\"></path>     <path fill=\"#6AD4DB\" d=\"M284.715 257.995C284.609 258.062 284.489 258.128 284.382 258.208C279.574 261.325 275.125 264.921 271.036 269.011C262.99 277.056 256.677 286.646 252.121 297.782C247.553 308.917 245.275 321.332 245.275 335.011C245.275 348.691 247.553 361.119 252.121 372.241C253.666 376.024 255.425 379.633 257.383 383.07C245.062 381.458 232.741 379.846 220.42 378.221C213.826 388.012 207.233 397.788 200.626 407.579C199.454 405.421 198.335 403.223 197.256 400.985C196.177 398.761 195.152 396.483 194.166 394.179C186.374 375.944 182.484 356.217 182.484 335.011C182.484 313.806 186.374 294.092 194.166 275.844C201.945 257.609 212.601 241.705 226.161 228.158C231.222 223.11 235.858 219.234 239.347 216.503C239.374 216.463 239.414 216.45 239.441 216.437C252.774 217.662 266.121 218.901 279.454 220.126L282.065 237.869L284.715 257.995Z\"></path>     <path fill=\"#C9E8F4\" d=\"M442.903 231.568L399.027 274.232C391.515 265.654 382.524 258.475 372.068 252.707C361.598 246.939 349.117 244.049 334.625 244.049C322.011 244.049 310.276 246.207 299.407 250.496C294.186 252.561 289.284 255.051 284.715 257.995L279.454 220.126L239.44 216.437C249.857 208.285 261.472 201.532 274.259 196.15C292.774 188.371 312.754 184.482 334.226 184.482C357.842 184.482 378.301 188.505 395.604 196.563C412.92 204.609 428.678 216.277 442.903 231.568Z\"></path>     <path fill=\"#318D93\" d=\"M449.75 432.42C420.219 467.838 381.725 485.554 334.226 485.554C312.754 485.554 292.774 481.651 274.259 473.872C255.744 466.093 239.707 455.424 226.16 441.878C216.037 431.768 207.526 420.339 200.639 407.605C200.639 407.605 200.639 407.592 200.626 407.592L220.419 378.221L257.382 383.083C261.179 389.743 265.734 395.724 271.035 401.025C279.081 409.071 288.551 415.251 299.407 419.54C310.276 423.829 322.011 425.974 334.625 425.974C349.93 425.974 363.21 422.897 374.479 416.716C385.747 410.549 395.937 401.691 405.061 390.156L449.75 432.42Z\"></path> </svg></span><span class=\"gb-headline-text\"><strong>PRO TIP</strong></span></p>\n\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-c992ef0f gb-headline-text\">When talking about your skills and experiences, make sure to relate them to what the company needs.

gb-headline-text\"><strong><strong><strong><em><strong><em><strong><strong><em>Show How Your Past Wins Can Be Their Future Success</em></strong></strong></em></strong></em></strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A common mistake job seekers make when interviewing is not connecting the dots between their experience and the company they\u2019re targeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interviewees often share great stories and examples from their careers yet fail to explain how they plan to replicate this experience for the prospective employer, which is a missed opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, all it takes is adding a sentence or two at the end of your meeting explaining how you plan to repeat your success at your next employer.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Being Too Afraid To Talk Highly About Yourself</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn\u2019t the time to be humble or afraid to talk highly of yourself! It\u2019s okay to sound confident and show off what you\u2019d bring to the role, or <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-sets-you-apart/\">what sets you apart from other candidates.&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, it\u2019s essential to tread carefully, as there\u2019s a fine line between confidence and arrogance. Boasting excessively or dismissing others\u2019 contributions can come across as arrogant and may turn off potential employers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Not Preparing in Advance</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, it\u2019s a huge mistake to say you don\u2019t know. The interviewer wants a specific answer when they ask what you would bring to their company and position. Don\u2019t ever say something like, \u201cI\u2019m not sure. I just need a job.\u201d Instead, prepare by reviewing the answer examples we looked at and researching the job description until you can give that same type of answer!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s the best way to prepare a strong response and make sure you approach this question correctly in the interview.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Final Advice</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the interviewer asks, \u201cWhat can you bring to the company?\u201d then split your time between talking about the specific role and the company. Focus on talking about what you can bring to the job first, then the organization.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If they ask what you\u2019d bring to this particular job, then focus entirely on talking about the role and how you\u2019re a good fit for their requirements and needs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter what variation of this interview question you hear, be prepared to talk about specific job-related skills and knowledge in your answer. Don\u2019t say, <em>\u201cI\u2019m very hard-working and have excellent communication skills.\u201d </em>It\u2019s better to say to an employer,<em> \u201cI saw the job description says that you prefer someone with experience selling to enterprise clients, and in my last role, enterprise sales was my full focus.\u201d</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you follow the tips above, you\u2019ll have a great answer to, \u201cWhat can you bring to this job?\u201d or, \u201cWhat can you bring to our company?\u201d that will impress interviewers and get you more <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/how-to-write-a-job-offer-letter-template-examples/\">job offers</a>.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-33d7847d\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-e6adffce\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-34cbb528\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-34cbb528\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-5db80e85\">\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-base-2-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-base-2-background-color has-background\">\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-0ec43197\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-2e6a8c4d\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-7b1c6b54\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-7b1c6b54\">\n\n<figure class=\"gb-block-image gb-block-image-8796466a\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"503\" height=\"496\" class=\"gb-image gb-image-8796466a perfmatters-lazy\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='503'%20height='496'%20viewBox='0%200%20503%20496'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"picture of Biron Clark\" title=\"Biron-Clark-meet-team\" data-src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1.png 503w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1-300x296.png 300w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"503\" height=\"496\" class=\"gb-image gb-image-8796466a\" src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1.png\" alt=\"picture of Biron Clark\" title=\"Biron-Clark-meet-team\" srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1.png 503w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1-300x296.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\" /></noscript></figure>\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-6d502a65\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-6d502a65\">\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-aefdd19e gb-headline-text\"><strong>About the Author</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-2630df48 gb-headline-text\">Biron Clark is a former executive recruiter who has worked individually with hundreds of job seekers, reviewed thousands of resumes and LinkedIn profiles, and recruited for top venture-backed startups and Fortune 500 companies.

They want to make sure you\u2019re willing to go beyond your job duties. They don\u2019t want to hire someone who\u2019s going to find the company in a tough situation, and instead of volunteering to do a bit extra, say, \u201cSorry, that\u2019s not a part of my job description.\u201d&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.azquotes.com/author/57535-Stewart_Butterfield\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stewart Butterfield</a>, co-founder of Slack, highlights the marketing potential of going over and beyond in customer service:</strong></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-85f78f53\">\n\n<p>\u201cEvery customer interaction is a marketing opportunity. If you go above and beyond on the customer service side, people are much more likely to recommend you.\u201d This underscores how going the extra mile benefits internal team dynamics and enhances the company\u2019s overall reputation and customer loyalty.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p>Next, employers ask this to measure your problem-solving ability. Were you able to think outside the box and come up with a smart, effective solution? Can you adjust to difficult situations?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your answer to this question shows the interviewer how engaged you can be in finding solutions in tight situations. This ability is crucial for businesses and recruiters look out for it. <a href=\"https://genesishrsolutions.com/peo-blog/employee-engagement-statistics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Data</a> shows that business units with highly engaged employees are 23% more profitable. Similarly, 71% of executives consider employee engagement critical to their companies\u2019 success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, they want to see how you perform under pressure. Were you able to stay calm and relaxed through this experience? Or did you panic?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is just one of many <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/20-behavioral-interview-questions-and-answers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">job interview questions</a> designed to measure your performance under pressure. Staying cool under pressure is an important skill that many employers look for.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Examples of Going Above and Beyond</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Volunteering to lead a major project outside your usual responsibilities.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"2\">\n<li>Staying late to ensure a critical deadline is met.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"3\">\n<li>Mentoring new team members to help them integrate smoothly.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"4\">\n<li>Proactively identifying and resolving potential issues before they escalate.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"5\">\n<li>Developing a new, efficient process that saves the company time and money.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"6\">\n<li>Taking on additional tasks to support a colleague who is overwhelmed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"7\">\n<li>Creating comprehensive documentation for processes to benefit the entire team.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"8\">\n<li>Consistently delivering work ahead of schedule with exceptional quality.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"9\">\n<li>Suggesting and implementing innovative ideas that improve team productivity.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"10\">\n<li>Offering to represent the team in important meetings or presentations.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to Answer, \u201cTell Me About a Time You Went Above and Beyond\u201d</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, you might have several stories that come to mind, making it difficult to choose the best one.

gb-headline-text\"><strong><strong><strong><em><strong><em><strong><strong><em><strong>Dig Deep to Identify Standout Moments</strong></em></strong></strong></em></strong></em></strong></strong></strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIt can be difficult to self-reflect and identify your biggest career wins, particularly if you come from a background or culture where self-promotion is frowned upon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rather than reinvent the wheel, see if you can dig up any preexisting materials that document when you\u2019ve gone above and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might look like an email to the department or entire company, team meeting notes, quarterly business reviews (QBR), or performance reviews. Then, see what trends emerge as you review these pre-existing documents.\u201d</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to Identify the Right Situation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Through years of working in career development, I\u2019ve noticed that the most effective candidates choose situations based on two key factors: the relevance of the situation to the job and the impact and outcome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Relevance to the Job</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>I recommend sharing a work-related story, even if they don\u2019t specifically ask for that. Having been an interviewer myself, I\u2019ve found that work-related examples are more impactful and relevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, a recent story is often more convincing. Choose an example from your last one or two jobs or from a similar role in the same industry. This makes your accomplishment more relevant to the hiring manager.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Impact and Outcome</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, make sure it\u2019s a story with a great ending. In the job interview, you want to share examples where your actions exceeded expectations and brought about a great result! Thus, you should tell a story with a positive impact/outcome for your previous employers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use the STAR Method</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on my experience, the <strong>S.T.A.R (Situation, Task, Action &amp; Result)</strong> method is the best and most straightforward way to break down <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/common-job-interview-questions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">behavioral interview questions</a>, which are questions based on how you acted in specific situations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>First, describe the situation you were in.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"2\">\n<li>Then, explain the task at hand, or the challenge you had to overcome.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"3\">\n<li>Next, explain the action or plan you chose and why.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\" start=\"4\">\n<li>Finally, describe the result and outcome (ideally a result where you exceeded expectations or helped the company get out of a tricky situation).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-6273b406 box-shadow\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-8ce4d115\">\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"556\" height=\"192\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='556'%20height='192'%20viewBox='0%200%20556%20192'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82757 perfmatters-lazy\" style=\"width:200px\" data-src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-1.png 556w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-1-300x104.png 300w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"556\" height=\"192\" src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-82757\" style=\"width:200px\" srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-1.png 556w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/image-1-300x104.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 556px) 100vw, 556px\" /></noscript></figure>\n\n</div>\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Situation: </strong>At my previous job as a <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/software-developer/\">software developer</a>, we were facing delays in a major project due to a lack of automated testing.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Task: </strong>We needed an efficient testing framework to speed up the development process.

Blaming or badmouthing coworkers or customers is one of the most critical mistakes you should never make. You can say, \u201cI was talking to a customer who was quite upset.\u201d But don\u2019t say, \u201cI was dealing with a terrible customer.\u201d No company wants to hear you talk like that!</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Overemphasizing Team Efforts:</strong> While it\u2019s good to acknowledge the team\u2019s role, interviewers are interested in understanding your specific actions and how you personally made a difference. Highlighting your individual contributions helps demonstrate your unique skills and initiative.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Lying</strong>: Don\u2019t fabricate a story. Even with minimal work experience, you can draw examples from volunteer work, school projects, or extracurricular activities.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Unethical Actions</strong>: Avoid unethical actions in your responses. They can reflect poorly on your character and integrity. Examples of unethical actions include taking credit for someone else\u2019s work or breaking company rules.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Being Too Vague</strong>: Providing a vague or generalized response can make it difficult for the interviewer to understand the specifics of your actions and their impact. Always use clear and specific examples.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Additional Resources</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Learn how to effectively respond to \u201c<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/why-can-you-do-well-in-this-job/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Why Would You Do Well in This Job?</a>\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Practical guide on how to answer the question \u201c<a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-sets-you-apart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">What Sets You Apart from Other Candidates?</a>\u201d</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Tackle challenging interviews with our guide on the <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/60-hardest-interview-questions-and-answers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">60 Hardest Interview Questions and Answers</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Get ready for tough scenarios with these <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/time-when-you-failed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Sample Answers to \u201cTell Me About a Time You Failed\u201d</a></li>\n</ul>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-33d7847d\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-e6adffce\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-34cbb528\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-34cbb528\">\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-5db80e85\">\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-base-2-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-base-2-background-color has-background\">\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-0ec43197\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-2e6a8c4d\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-7b1c6b54\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-7b1c6b54\">\n\n<figure class=\"gb-block-image gb-block-image-8796466a\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"503\" height=\"496\" class=\"gb-image gb-image-8796466a perfmatters-lazy\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='503'%20height='496'%20viewBox='0%200%20503%20496'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" alt=\"picture of Biron Clark\" title=\"Biron-Clark-meet-team\" data-src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1.png 503w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1-300x296.png 300w\" data-sizes=\"(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"503\" height=\"496\" class=\"gb-image gb-image-8796466a\" src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1.png\" alt=\"picture of Biron Clark\" title=\"Biron-Clark-meet-team\" srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1.png 503w, https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Biron-Clark-removebg-preview-1-300x296.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 503px) 100vw, 503px\" /></noscript></figure>\n\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-6d502a65\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-6d502a65\">\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-aefdd19e gb-headline-text\"><strong>About the Author</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-2630df48 gb-headline-text\">Biron Clark is a former executive recruiter who has worked individually with hundreds of job seekers, reviewed thousands of resumes and LinkedIn profiles, and recruited for top venture-backed startups and Fortune 500 companies.

You\u2019re sick</strong>.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Feeling ill is one of the best excuses for missing work, as your company/boss will not want you in the office if you\u2019re sick and possibly contagious.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pros</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Staying away from work while sick prevents the spread of disease to other co-workers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It gives you more time for recovery and ultimately helps you stay productive in the long term.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Companies typically have policies for calling out sick, and your request will likely be granted.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cons</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Calling out sick often means more responsibility for colleagues.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Some workplaces don\u2019t offer paid sick leave, so missing a day could mean lost wages.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>There\u2019s also the potential for extra work when you eventually recover.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Irrespective of the potential cons, sickness is still one of the most legitimate excuses to get out of work. Putting yourself under extra pressure when you\u2019re not feeling too well is not ideal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to a <a href=\"https://www.bamboohr.com/resources/guides/sick-guilt-2023\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">survey by Bamboo HR</a>, almost 90% of employees work through sickness or feel guilty when calling out of work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-50813796#:~:text=%22If%20you%20are%20really%20not%20well%20and%20your%20symptoms%20mean%20you%20are%20not%20going%20to%20be%20productive%2C%20it%27s%20better%20to%20go%20off%20sick.%20You%27re%20also%20not%20spreading%20your%20germs%20around%20the%20workplace.%22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Rachel Suff,</a> senior policy adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), says:</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-a36f9577\">\n\n<p>\u201cRemember, your health is paramount.

Here are five best practices to ensure a smooth process whenever you need to call out of work.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Communicating with the employer as soon as possible: </strong>The earlier you can communicate your absence to your supervisor, the better they can adjust tasks and schedules. This helps minimize disruption in workflow.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Adhering to the company\u2019s protocols: </strong>Many companies have established procedures for calling out of work. You should follow these procedures to ensure everything is documented properly and avoid confusion.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Suggesting potential solutions to minimize disruption caused by your absence:</strong> If you can, offer suggestions to minimize the impact of your absence. This might take the form of creating a handover document to bring the person covering for you up to speed.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Staying in touch and giving updates: </strong>Depending on the circumstances surrounding your absence, it might be helpful to check in from time to time. This is especially important if you\u2019re out for an extended period. Doing this shows your commitment to work and keeps your employer informed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Does Calling Out of Work on Short Notice Leave a Negative Impression?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone misses work from time to time, and it\u2019s not necessarily a bad sign that you need to take an unexpected day off. However, if you fail to inform your employer early enough and cause difficulties such as scheduling issues, then it could leave your boss upset. You shouldn\u2019t feel bad about telling your employer you need a day off for any of the reasons above, but give them as much notice as possible. Also, avoid making it a frequent habit to call out.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Can You Get Fired for Calling in Sick?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In many states, work is considered to be done \u201cat-will,\u201d which means an employer can technically fire you for calling in sick. However, each state provides different rights to employees. No matter where you live, it\u2019s unlikely that an employer will fire you for taking one sick day or calling out of work occasionally.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How Often Can You Call Out of Work?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is difficult to give a one-size-fits-all answer to how often you can call out of work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are some considerations to have in mind:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Employer policy:</strong> Understand your company\u2019s sick leave policy and procedures for absences.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Job requirements: </strong>Consider how crucial your physical presence is for your role. If essential, have a backup plan.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Work flexibility: </strong>Explore possibilities of remote work if your job allows it.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Communication: </strong>Be honest and open with your manager about your needs.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Build trust: </strong>Consistent good work helps establish trust for occasional absences.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Not to Say When You Call in Sick</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To wrap up, here are a couple of mistakes to avoid and bad reasons for calling out of work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, you never want to say anything that suggests you failed to plan ahead or that you didn\u2019t let them know promptly. Don\u2019t give a reason that sounds like it\u2019s something you would have known about days before.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other big mistake to avoid is overexplaining. You don\u2019t need to share every detail when you explain why you can\u2019t come to your job for one day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you say you have a sick child, you don\u2019t need to share every symptom as proof that they\u2019re not feeling well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re going to say that you\u2019re sick, you don\u2019t need to try to cough on the phone or sound miserable. Just be clear and direct, give the general excuse/reason that you\u2019re going to use to miss work, and then stop talking and see how your boss responds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you call out of work, it\u2019s often better to say less.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bad Planning</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many good excuses to call out of work; poor planning is not one of them. Poor planning is not a quality any boss wants to see in their employee. Of course, some emergencies are understandable, but reasons like missing the bus or forgetting to set the alarm aren\u2019t likely to go down well, especially when it happens too often.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Forgot You Had A Shift</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Forgetting you had a shift is surely not one of the good excuses to miss work on short notice. Everyone makes mistakes. But forgetting that you had to go to work or had a shift to attend points, once again, to bad planning. Your best bet, in this case, would be to apologize profusely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Work Conflicts</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Conflicts with coworkers can be hard to deal with. However, your employer will likely have little patience for you if you miss work due to an interpersonal conflict. Talking things through with your employer or coworker might be a better solution.</p>\n\t\t</div>\n\n\t\t<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-5db80e85\">\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-text-color has-base-2-color has-alpha-channel-opacity has-base-2-background-color has-background\">\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-0ec43197\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-2e6a8c4d\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-7b1c6b54\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-7b1c6b54\">\n<figure class=\"gb-block-image gb-block-image-8796466a\"><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/author/biron/\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='150'%20height='150'%20viewBox='0%200%20150%20150'%3E%3C/svg%3E\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" alt=\"Biron Clark\" class=\"avatar avatar-150 wp-user-avatar wp-user-avatar-150 alignnone photo gb-image-8796466a perfmatters-lazy\" data-src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Biron-Clark-uai-158x158.png\" data-srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Biron-Clark-uai-336x336.png 2x\"><noscript><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Biron-Clark-uai-158x158.png\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://careersidekick.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Biron-Clark-uai-336x336.png 2x\" alt=\"Biron Clark\" class=\"avatar avatar-150 wp-user-avatar wp-user-avatar-150 alignnone photo gb-image-8796466a\" /></noscript></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-6d502a65\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-6d502a65\">\n\n<p class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-aefdd19e gb-headline-text\"><strong>About the Author</strong></p>\n\n\n<div style=\"font-size:16px;\" class=\"wp-block-post-author-biography\">Biron Clark is a former executive recruiter who has worked individually with hundreds of job seekers, reviewed thousands of resumes and LinkedIn profiles, and recruited for top venture-backed startups and Fortune 500 companies.

This ensures your supervisor and colleagues view occasional early departures as rare exceptions, not regular occurrences.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-23ee4ae9\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-wrapper gb-grid-wrapper-d35f5dca\">\n<div class=\"gb-grid-column gb-grid-column-aee72f4c\"><div class=\"gb-container gb-container-aee72f4c\">\n\n<h3 class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-b44e51eb gb-headline-text\"><strong>Highlights</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"has-small-font-size wp-block-list\">\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">To maintain credibility, ensure your reason for leaving is believable and fits the situation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Consider the <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-is-company-culture-how-to-improve-yours/\">company culture</a> and your employer\u2019s expectations before deciding on an excuse.</li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Depending on the excuse, be prepared for potential follow-up questions and have a consistent story.</li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Avoid sharing too much detail about why you need to leave.</li>\n\n\n\n<li style=\"font-size:16px\">Excuses should be used sparingly as habitual early departures are not recommended.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Understanding the Workplace Policy on Leaving Early</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each company has its own policies for time off, sick leave, personal time, and leaving work early.

Giving as much advance notice as possible shows consideration and respect for their time.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Communicating With Your Boss</strong>:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Framing Your Request</strong>: Use a polite and professional tone. For example, \u201cI have a personal matter that requires my attention. May I leave early today?\u201d</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Information to Include and What to Withhold</strong>: Include essential details like the reason and how your tasks will be managed in your absence. Withhold overly personal information to maintain professional boundaries.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dharmesh/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dharmesh/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dharmesh Shah</a>, Founder and CTO at HubSpot:</strong></p>\n\n\n<div class=\"gb-container gb-container-85f78f53\">\n\n<p>\u201cYour goal should be to work in a job where you sometimes leave on time \u2014 but not always. Sometimes you leave early (because the company cares more about results than how long you\u2019re at you\u2019re desk), and sometimes you leave later (not because you have to, but because you want to) \u2013 to help others, to finish what you started, to get one more thing done\u2026&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you should work in a place where sometimes you leave early, because it\u2019s your daughter\u2019s first dance recital, or you\u2019re heading out for the weekend for your best friend\u2019s wedding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, not all hours are created equal.

Avoid these to maintain your professionalism and trust with your employer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Never mention job interviews</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t tell your boss or HR that you need time off for job interviews at another company. This is NEVER a good idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wait until you have accepted a new job offer before discussing your job search with your current employer. This approach protects your current position and maintains your professional image.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Avoid reasons you should have known in advance</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoid using excuses like family obligations (e.g., a wedding or party) that you should have planned for in advance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your boss will wonder why you didn\u2019t request time off earlier. Leaving work early puts your boss in a difficult position, so choose reasons that are genuinely last-minute and unavoidable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These points are crucial because, as an experienced <a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/careers-recruiter/\">recruiter</a>, I\u2019ve seen how poor excuses can damage professional relationships and career prospects.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why acceptable reasons for leaving early often relate to sudden illness or unpredictable emergencies. Planning and transparency are key to maintaining trust and professionalism in the workplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">More Resources</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/excuses-to-miss-work/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">12 Best Excuses to Miss Work (Last Minute/Short Notice)</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/sick-day-emails/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">7 Sick Day Email Templates to Get the Day Off</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/how-to-request-a-mental-health-day-off-work-with-sample-emails/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">How To Request a Mental Health Day Off Work (With Sample Emails)</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://careersidekick.com/what-is-a-leave-of-absence-everything-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">What Is a Leave of Absence?
