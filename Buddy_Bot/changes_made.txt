## Changes made to improve the embed_job model:

1. Make exact matching fields as keywords
2. Try different models for embedding
3. Apply filters if any before applying knn to reduce time for search
4. Batching csv data to reduce overhead
5. No Need for Full-Text Search: Since we're using the vectors for kNN-based search (similarity search), we don't need Elasticsearch to build inverted indexes for the vectors.
